It's not really that we have a monopoly on Reddit's advertising system, it's just that there are not a lot of advertisers on Reddit in general. We actually pay the minimum amount required per day to advertise ($30 per subreddit), and are usually competing with a few different ads each day. Redditors love the site, the 5K+ upvotes and comments are all legit (as krispykrackers confirmed above), and this ad brings us a ton of new visitors, so it's worthwhile for us to keep this ad running every day.

There is a protective liner along the inside of the can, protecting the metal from the liquid, however it is easily punctured, particularly if the can has ever been dented (either by you or somewhere along the process shipping from the factory to the store). Once that happens, it's not a question of if but when it will begin to leak everywhere and destroy everything you hold dear.

The problem that drives reposts isn't a lack of content - it's a lack of good content, and good ways to separate the good from the bad. The reason we get reposts is that they've already gotten past the "is this good or bad?" filter, and so can be depended on. If good content is a needle in a stack of shit, then reposts are all those needles that have been painstakingly grabbed from the shit and already set aside.

The only really notable difference is that you could stack scenery. In the first one you could only build little walls on the grass, but once you are able to stack scenery, you can work upward too, so it allowed you to build little houses and things, with roofs and that. This made little difference to the game, but once the modding community got hold of it, they made their own scenery, and used this new stacking ability to make incredibly complex structures and things. Just take a look at the links I provided, it's amazing, but still so time consuming; each piece on each square is placed by hand.

Mitt Romney was born in 1947, meaning he would have been 19 in 1966. Age 19 is exactly in the age range where every male member of the LDS church goes on a mission. It's not "convenient", it's just how LDS missions work.

Former Mormon here, not every 19 year old boy goes on a mission, it's a choice. So he clearly chose to do that while avoiding the draft. There were plenty of men that chose the opposite even though they were Mormon 19 year olds.

In the age of the internet, we can check and verify, the truthfulness of /r/politics, and yet these people are flat out saying "LIBERAL MEDIA"; one person in /r/askreddit, got downvoted for saying 'liberal media myth', and people accused him of liberal bias.

It's the same brain washing that keeps kids in at night and teaches them to brush their teeth, so let's not take that thought process TOO far.  It comes down to humans being limited in their abilities.  The spectrum is so wide, so vast that anyone wanting to cast a wide political net must first chose to generalized a possibly misleading message, and every political message needs a boogey-man.  When you look at the messages closely it's clear - Democrats blame the republicans, themselves and the past.  The republicans blame anyone but themselves at all costs, and they almost always blame the opponent as a part of their opening line, and then go on to vaguely offer a solution, to be explained and executed AFTER the republican is placed in office.  I'm not saying the democrats are being honest or informed in their description of the placed blame, but I am saying that when a kid comes up to you and blames everyone in the world but himself for the broken lamp, it's pretty clear what happened. Now in this scenario with a broken lamp, a kid with an excuse, and mom the results are clear, but what if this house is full of a LOT of other kids and some adults, but everyone gets equal votes?  That kid with the explanation of what went wrong simply has to speak more loudly and keep his story on track to convince enough OTHER kids that his story is true.  That is the simple method in which the republicans ensure the race will always be close these days, vague up the message to everyone, relying on how busy and uninformed people HAVE to be thanks to the limitations of humans in a drowning economy, and always blame the other guy no matter what.  The only thing that can bring down this type of play is an informed public, and so far we ain't gettin' that.

But it's totally true.  The money is in Washington.  And every President, Senator and Congressmen participates in the corruption.  Even your grand leader ___ (enter name here) is corrupt.  You want real change you need to understand that almost everything you learn in school is a lie to brainwash you into a system of slavery.  Once you know that to be true you can start re-learning the truths of the world and help wake up others.  The only way to change and be free is to educate everyone in what it means to be free.  Religion and Government are here to control you.  These elections mean nothing.  Whoever you vote for will not change things for the better for you, but only change things for the government by consolidation.  The govenment will get bigger and control more and more and make more laws.  And you will still be a worker.  The education system is here to indoctrinate you into thinking you can't survive without being someone's employee - IE: someones slave.  It's never about you being free to live without needing to be an employee.  You don't get taught to own your own land, farm and grow food for yourself.  It's always about you working for someone else, getting paid money to go to the store to buy their crap that you could have grown yourself.   Learn what Serfdom means.  Obama is for big corporations, war, wallstreet, and bailouts for bankers.  Romney is the same.  Make no mistake they are the same.  They want war and money and they don't give a damn about you.  They never did.  Grow up.

I absolutely cannot wait to play this game, and I'm even considering buying a dedicated gaming rig just to play it in all it's glory! http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/11wivt/i_am_chris_roberts_creator_of_wing_commander/c6q7glq

According to this interview with Linn, it appears that she bought her first Kindle used,  so it's not entirely inconceivable that it's related to the account tied to the previous owner of that Kindle.

Amazon is now going to release a statement explaining what happened, and it's going to turn out that this woman's Credit Card information has been used in multiple other accounts and Amazon was basically just shutting down all the accounts so that card can't be used anymore on their site.

THAT SAID, how Amazon's handling this is bullshit and they should absolutely be providing her with enough information to know exactly what's going on.  Plus, of course, it's rather troubling to think that your Kindle and everything you purchased for it could be wiped out entirely at the whim of Amazon, with no recourse besides legal action.

I had a similar problem with Amazon, I think for them it's par for the course to not provide any details why they close an account. I tried calling them a few times - at one time one of the customer reps said that there was no problem with my account, but with an account from a customer in another city who has the same name as I do. (Fine, I have an relatively unusual name, but not that unusual. And really - the credit card details say where I live, so why is that an issue?)

In my experience it's fairly typical for large companies not to provide details in cases which are related to some kind of account fraud or related abuse. The more details they make available, the more vulnerable their detection tech is to gaming by scammers.

See, the problem is, when I see Amazon could suspend my account by mistake and deny me access to the stuff I bought from them, not tell me why or otherwise try to help fix the mistake, and my only recourse would be to get a lawyer and perhaps go to court, as a potential customer it just doesn't make me want to do business with them. It's too risky and complicated. And it's their loss more than it is mine.

Digital media with restrictions like this should be treated for what they are: rentals. As such, they are only deserving of a rental's price. This is why I never spend more than $10 for a Steam game, or $1-2 for an eBook. If it's not mine, then it's still the seller's, in which case they don't deserve full price for it.

The point here isn't who caused the problem, the point here is that Amazon isn't even trying to help this customer fix it. The worst part, for me, is where they stated that "any subsequent account" would be closed as well. What the actual fuck? This is essentially banning the person altogether. I don't think it's wrong to terminate the account of someone who broke the rules, but to keep terminating any new accounts after they've learned a lesson? That's just mean and hostile. And especially so if you refuse to tell the person why you banned them to begin with.

I also don't like this weird digital-age notion content producers have that they can take back what they sold you. If a copy of a file on your computer is considered an "item" (as they insist it is when pirates "publish" millions of copies), and you've bought it, then it's theft for them to take it back. Imagine if publishers (or recording studios, or movie studios) were allowed to walk into your home and box up your books, movies, and DVDs. I would call the goddamn cops on them, and they would go to jail, because that's theft.

This personalization has a really negative effect on how we are informed as citizens. Just by browsing Reddit, you'll passively reinforce particular existing views - and even radicalize them. Without any content to counter or challenge the things we want to see, Reddit essentially becomes an echo chamber. We hear what we already think because the website is personalized to us, and because we hear it again, we think it's right. This effect is vastly compounded if Reddit is your only source of news. Because there is no overarching content control, there is no pressure to supply the other side(s) to issues.

Politifact looked into it and found out Obama's pension is set up through the Cayman islands with investments in China. It's also much larger than Romney's. This isn't necessarily the Presidents fault as it's a blind investment setup through Illinois but highly hypocritical of his administration to criticize Romney for the same thing.

Maybe, but since the start of the month Obama has the lead in 4 polls compared to Romney's 8. Most of these leads on both sides are within the margin of error, but still I'd say it's more likely to go for Romney.

However, polls always have a margin of error, and even that margin of error is not an absolute indicator due to the confidence margin or whatever the statistical term is. I.e. a poll can have a 4 point margin of error but a 1 in 20 chance of being off the mark anyways, I think it's called a p-value, I never actually had a class on it all.

Well, seeing as a ton of the posts from r/politics are just retarded blogs, and at least 50% of the posts are filled with top comments saying "this article is complete bullshit" with intelligent discussion as to why, and then the second or third top comment is "People need to see this and wake up! This country is being destroyed. We aren't free! Romney will destroy us all!" I think it's safe to say that we are incredibly distorted. Not that others aren't, but if you believe Reddit isn't a source with a huge democratic bias, you probably don't value facts that much when it comes to making up your mind about something.  The truth and lies that a news article is composed of is like a smoothie of propaganda, which is which is only distinguishable if you put in the time to check sources, reliability, and how much facts are stretched.

Haha thank you. Although I do provide some evidence in some of my replies to back up the claim that this school is supposed to be good. But I don't see how it's not believable that a video of kids being kids (not really kids) can come from a school with high test scores. No matter where you are, at the ages of 14–18 you're going to do ridiculous things and be rowdy. In fact, you probably know that in these schools no one really causes trouble, so that's why the teachers don't shut it down right away because they know it probably won't get too out of control despite how loud it is. I'm guessing within a minute after the video stopped, some high up faculty walks by, tells them to quiet down, and everyone goes back to being normal.

Yeah, except the whole child prodigy thing. I'm not a fan of her or her music but she apparently has some serious chops. Also pop music is meant to be superficial and vapid. Consequently it's also designed to make a lot of money as well. During every part of modern music there are people that hear whatever is popular and decry how it's leading to the decay of society. It's just not true. Jazz and Rock n' Roll were supposed to lead to the doom of the world, but that never happened. Basically you just shouldn't make sweeping generalizations like that based on the like 2 songs you heard from her.

As a competent guitar player, I'm at the point where I don't like certain players because of the knowledge that being a musician imparts to me. For me one of these players is Slash. As a rock band, G'n'R is pretty great, but I can't just listen to them without analyzing Slash's playing. It sounds good, but it's not great in the guitar realm. When my relatives found out I was a guitar player they all seemed to jump on the "play me Sweet Child" bandwagon but when I explained that I didn't know it because I didn't like Slash, their response was akin to "shut up, he's famous and you're not, so he's done something right."

I don't think news articles paint the picture right.  There's company involvement all over the place, but most farms, in the states I have lived in, are actually owned and operated by farmers, then they give their crops to a pool/company that distributes.  If a company owns a farm, it's a company started by the family that started the farm.  I have two grandmothers that own a substantial amount of family farms, which act as their retirement income.  The farm is still mostly operated by family members though.

If we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?  Um.  Well, I don't believe we did come from monkeys, so this is a moot question.  But assuming that I did not believe, according to my understanding of evolution, it's not so much that people came from monkeys, but rather that they shared a similar ancestor.

I definitely understand where you're coming from and I appreciate the sentiment. I just feel sad when I look at myself and don't see what I would like. I've gotten over any embarrassment with regards to what others think. I'd really like to just be happy with what I have, and most of the time it's not on my mind at all, but if I'm being honest I'd love to fill in shirts and dresses better, not bust out of them, but just fit properly so they aren't hanging off of me. I hate clothes shopping and that's a big part of why, nothing is really designed for flat girls. Not in my income range anyway.

It seems like it's always 8/10
It's not really that we have a monopoly on Reddit's advertising system, it's just that there are not a lot of advertisers on Reddit in general. We actually pay the minimum amount required per day to advertise ($30 per subreddit), and are usually competing with a few different ads each day. Redditors love the site, the 5K+ upvotes and comments are all legit (as krispykrackers confirmed above), and this ad brings us a ton of new visitors, so it's worthwhile for us to keep this ad running every day.
It's because it's the same thread being promoted, those are the same comments you see everytime.

"Apelsin - Kolsyrad läskedryck" Basically means that it's orange flavored carbonated soda.
Not that anyone would likely crack it open and drink it... but if it's been in storage for roughly as long as it is old without severe agitation, all the syrup and additives have come out of suspension... the top part is all carbonated water, and the lower part is all syrup and coloring.
I cracked a Pepsi from dad's cupboard and realized that the soda was bland-- thought, "oh... it's just caffeine free... and flavor free."  So I poured it in the sink and it came out clear followed by brown sludge.
There is a protective liner along the inside of the can, protecting the metal from the liquid, however it is easily punctured, particularly if the can has ever been dented (either by you or somewhere along the process shipping from the factory to the store). Once that happens, it's not a question of if but when it will begin to leak everywhere and destroy everything you hold dear.

Your park rating will drop, but it's oh so fun.
It was one of those deals where they released almost the exact same game but with a few minor changes and called it '2'. There are new rides and things, it's more or less an expansion park.
The only really notable difference is that you could stack scenery. In the first one you could only build little walls on the grass, but once you are able to stack scenery, you can work upward too, so it allowed you to build little houses and things, with roofs and that. This made little difference to the game, but once the modding community got hold of it, they made their own scenery, and used this new stacking ability to make incredibly complex structures and things. Just take a look at the links I provided, it's amazing, but still so time consuming; each piece on each square is placed by hand.
But you're forgetting it's called Universe Sandbox.

That's what reddit's for.
Actually, it's >7 billion now.
Every 150 minutes there is 1 year of video uploaded, that is INCREDIBLE. My mind is blown just trying to comprehend consuming that much content and it's uploaded EVERY 150 minutes!
Reddit isn't useful to me because it's a link aggregator or a forum. It's useful because it's a scalable and universal system for screening content, from videos to products to music or fashion. Google has spent the last few years trying to tackle "social search." Reddit ended up doing by accident.
With inflation it's more like over 9.86 based on this huffpost article.
The problem that drives reposts isn't a lack of content - it's a lack of good content, and good ways to separate the good from the bad. The reason we get reposts is that they've already gotten past the "is this good or bad?" filter, and so can be depended on. If good content is a needle in a stack of shit, then reposts are all those needles that have been painstakingly grabbed from the shit and already set aside.
If you filter out videos of cats and crap lets plays, it's about 30 minutes.
This is strongly in line with the lifestyle of it's founder and CEO, Tristam Shandy.

Ya know sometimes, as a parent, it's just better to let your kid not eat their peas and green beans if they don't want to.
Because parents are supposed to be proud when their children kill or die for their country, not when they speak up when it's illegal or may offend people.
the speaking up I can deal with it's their right as humans to do so, the breaking and entering, destruction of property and assault I cannot.
It's an acceptable form of justice as far as I'm concerned since it's not changing the law it's just bending it so it doesn't create any dangerous precedents (i.e. they would of been charged with what they were charged with regardless but likely wouldn't of gotten anywhere near the max sentence if it wasn't for all this other stuff I'm guessing).

As for other two pussy riot members (one of which wasn't caught), it's not clear at all, since neither group has listed their membership for their own safety sake.
Because it's a horrible travesty to the values of the civilized and democratic world, which Russia half-heartedly pretends to be a part of.
I was born in the Soviet Union, and I guess it's clear why the West abandoned us after World War 2.
They're not progressive. They have never fought for anything in their lives. They're a typical US shopper/worker with a cozy priviliged life. In a bubble like that it's difficult to understand.
You're right, but as I said a few times now, it's almost guaranteed that their previous criminal history comes into consideration when a sentence is being handed down hence the 2 years they received.
Fun fact: there's a purposefully funny Russian dub of the Lord of the Rings, and Mordor becomes Mordovia, Gondor becomes Honduras, etc. In Russian it's hilarious.
I'm glad to have more facts, glad to have read the article. But I found it grating that the author emphasized what the facilities used to be used for by a different government. I get the symbolism here. The right way to handle this is to point out the symbolism and then report accurately about the current conditions at these facilities. Propaganda bothers me, even when it's for "my side."
This may be true, but to put bullshit quoted by them in the headline in such a way will make it seem like it's the truth.  Such a line should be in the article, and it should be followed with a debunking, but it shouldn't be the headline, as that will mislead people and the media knows this.
... but it's for their "singing", and not their activism, so it's completely justified.
that raises the question about the legitimacy of the protest, not the power => it's counterproductive

Use sacrificial drone comb - make absolutely sure it's removed while brood still capped
Interesting other issue are bats are coming down with the white nose syndrome (fungus) which is killing them off. They eat insects, and it's entirely possible that not only are we killing insects but in turn we are killing the animals that eat insects, too.
Maybe it's just me but I never really understood why people thought it was a great idea to spray poison all over and why they are surprised when it kills things. I mean, it doesn't take "human poison" to kill me - could be rat poison, could be weed poison, could be bug poison. Likewise with other life forms.
That's not what I meant, I guess I was unclear. What I meant is that it's unsurprising to me that pesticide and herbicide causes massive "collateral damage" to bees, seeing as how pesticide and herbicide at those levels would cause the same damage to most animals.
Sorry, I guess my comment was unclear. What I mean is that since obviously we spend some effort checking crops to make sure that the very small levels of residual pesticide/herbicide do not harm humans, it's utterly unsurprising that much higher levels of pesticide and herbicide harm bees.
Those insects become resistant to that pesticide (or it's found to be too toxic) and they stop it's use, and use something else.  And the cycle repeats.
someone finds a new article, or a new article finds old research.  And every time informed people groan because it's fairly well established as a bunch of causes, and pesticides aren't necessarily even a top one.
This research is important and novel because it's replicating field-level exposures on bumblebee colonies of two pesticides (a neonicitinoid and a pyrethroid) in combination as well as individually, this hasn't been done before.
Heck it's one of the reasons GM foods are so important. Because the current nuke spray effect of pesticides is far more harmful then the controlled levels plants naturally produce, and if we can replicate nature, it'll probably be better for everyone.
I don't think news articles paint the picture right.  There's company involvement all over the place, but most farms, in the states I have lived in, are actually owned and operated by farmers, then they give their crops to a pool/company that distributes.  If a company owns a farm, it's a company started by the family that started the farm.  I have two grandmothers that own a substantial amount of family farms, which act as their retirement income.  The farm is still mostly operated by family members though.
So since Agent Orange is a defoliant it's safe to eat.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11vz4g/amazon_closes_womans_account_and_wipes_her_kindle/
According to this interview with Linn, it appears that she bought her first Kindle used,  so it's not entirely inconceivable that it's related to the account tied to the previous owner of that Kindle.
I should add that in addition to emailing, I did call, several times. While it's hard to say if it helped, it was definitely more helpful than emailing.
I only got back a really surley fuck you type message. So then I inquired again politely and got the same shitty response back. Took the gloves off and, without any actual threats, etc mind you, just a bit of a tyraid on how they could treat their customers this way it's not right, etc etc, some tech emails me back saying I'm being threatening and has called the cops on me.
Amazon is now going to release a statement explaining what happened, and it's going to turn out that this woman's Credit Card information has been used in multiple other accounts and Amazon was basically just shutting down all the accounts so that card can't be used anymore on their site.
THAT SAID, how Amazon's handling this is bullshit and they should absolutely be providing her with enough information to know exactly what's going on.  Plus, of course, it's rather troubling to think that your Kindle and everything you purchased for it could be wiped out entirely at the whim of Amazon, with no recourse besides legal action.
Either way, while I'm not saying it's impossible this is 100% an error on Amazon's part, I'm still guessing there's more to the story on the customer's end than we're hearing.
I had a similar problem with Amazon, I think for them it's par for the course to not provide any details why they close an account. I tried calling them a few times - at one time one of the customer reps said that there was no problem with my account, but with an account from a customer in another city who has the same name as I do. (Fine, I have an relatively unusual name, but not that unusual. And really - the credit card details say where I live, so why is that an issue?)
In my experience it's fairly typical for large companies not to provide details in cases which are related to some kind of account fraud or related abuse. The more details they make available, the more vulnerable their detection tech is to gaming by scammers.
It's pretty baffling all around, so don't think I'm defending Amazon TOO much here.  I'm just saying, it's still safe to assume that companies have a purpose to their actions, at least most of the time.
With that said, this post is disturbing.  Regardless of whether she did or didn't do something wrong, or Amazon simply made a mistake, it's not good that we're headed in a direction where large corporations "own" what you "buy" and have the ability to repossess or destroy it with no explanation, no due process and no viable recourse.
I'm sure I've used terms like "purchased" to describe digital media before. I just wanted to use this opportunity to point out the distinction to people who might not otherwise know about it, because it's very relevant to the discussion at hand.
That's probably the most sensible idea. If she lost enough to be worth her time then she should at least contact the amazon legal department and say if it's not sorted out then she will take legal action.
See, the problem is, when I see Amazon could suspend my account by mistake and deny me access to the stuff I bought from them, not tell me why or otherwise try to help fix the mistake, and my only recourse would be to get a lawyer and perhaps go to court, as a potential customer it just doesn't make me want to do business with them. It's too risky and complicated. And it's their loss more than it is mine.
Digital media with restrictions like this should be treated for what they are: rentals. As such, they are only deserving of a rental's price. This is why I never spend more than $10 for a Steam game, or $1-2 for an eBook. If it's not mine, then it's still the seller's, in which case they don't deserve full price for it.
Interestingly enough, only Apple has thus far actually moved to a model embracing technology's strengths without the inane restrictions, but even there it's only with music (and still limited to lossy formats).
This. Also, it's not Amazon deciding on whether an e-book should have DRM or not, it's the publishers. Amazon's actually been fighting a huge legal battle against the publishers, in behalf of their customers to prevent the fucked-up pricing that's been happening (e-books costing as much, and sometimes more than the hard cover version).
The point here isn't who caused the problem, the point here is that Amazon isn't even trying to help this customer fix it. The worst part, for me, is where they stated that "any subsequent account" would be closed as well. What the actual fuck? This is essentially banning the person altogether. I don't think it's wrong to terminate the account of someone who broke the rules, but to keep terminating any new accounts after they've learned a lesson? That's just mean and hostile. And especially so if you refuse to tell the person why you banned them to begin with.
It's shitty, but well within the terms of service, and it's something people should be aware of before they tie so much of their life/purchases to an account that could be closed on a whim.
The problem is when problems occur which the customer service agent in India isn't capable of solving.  This is when you see the beautiful surface of Amazon peel away and what's left is a rotten core of cold heartless automation, the Hades of customer service.  By definition you will get absolutely no assistance here because it's completely devoid of human thought or compassion; again, Amazon is built to ignore the most time consuming customers.  They don't want you, and thus your complaints will be met with mindless form emails until you give up and leave.  Amazon: 1, Annoying Customer: 0.
Believe it or not, I still shop at Amazon because their shopping system is far and away the best.  And if something goes wrong I'm sure I can usually get a decent remedy.  But I have no illusions about the way the company works behind the scenes.  I hope nobody here personally has to deal with Amazon on the same level I did, because it's hell.
No, but it's how many businesses behave as soon as there is the slightest whiff of something that interests the "security" department.
It's usually an issue of some dipshit who loves the power they have to close accounts and goes overboard in assuming somethings bad or fishy when it's not. Once these folks close accounts, it usually took someone higher up like me to MAKE them understand they did a bad thing and open the account back up. Even then, they would smirk and say they weren't wrong. It was absurd.
E: Looks like the Internet killed the blog site. Basically it's someone saying Amazon killed his friend's account and remotely wiped her Kindle because the account was 'related to an existing closed account', and in the following email chain tells her any future accounts will also be closed and refuses to tell her any further details and ends with "we're not going to discuss the matter further" and "thank you for understanding our decision"
Yeah, I mean it's not like they are playing fair. It's a capitalist system, it pays off to be an opportunist, they take advantages of the system and it's fine. But when your avarage Joe does it, it is wrong?
I also don't like this weird digital-age notion content producers have that they can take back what they sold you. If a copy of a file on your computer is considered an "item" (as they insist it is when pirates "publish" millions of copies), and you've bought it, then it's theft for them to take it back. Imagine if publishers (or recording studios, or movie studios) were allowed to walk into your home and box up your books, movies, and DVDs. I would call the goddamn cops on them, and they would go to jail, because that's theft.
She probably violated some form of terms or contract a person does when registering their product. Rarely happens, except they took action. They may not be informing her of her breach do to reason of pursuing other activity related to her account. Although not fair it's my game plan if I was Amazon. Possible she was taking copywritten material and posting that data elsewhere. Uploading to torrents. Honestly a little extreme.

What wouldn't surprise me is hearing something equivalent from Obama. After 3 thankless years of trying to turn around problems he didn't create, while taking all the blame for it, he's still out there campaigning and trying to do the job again. Fucking amazing that he isn't up there going "Hey Romney it's all yours. Good luck, buddy. I'm going to go sit on a beach and watch the world burn."
He's saying the salesman needs to make more money for his family for when he dies. I mean it's either cars or blue meth.
That's because it's been conveniently left out of the media narrative.
Mitt Romney was born in 1947, meaning he would have been 19 in 1966. Age 19 is exactly in the age range where every male member of the LDS church goes on a mission. It's not "convenient", it's just how LDS missions work.
Former Mormon here, not every 19 year old boy goes on a mission, it's a choice. So he clearly chose to do that while avoiding the draft. There were plenty of men that chose the opposite even though they were Mormon 19 year olds.
The problem isn't just in the federal government as an organism, it's in individual government officials that have no integrity.
Unfortunately, there are enough people out there who take religion seriously enough that it's not very pragmatic to mock them in public.  It's not like you have to fall back on his religion to make Romney look ridiculous, anyway.
I think it's more that the title it's without context rather than being misleading. The title just quotes Romney.  I didn't interpret that to mean he running to make money at all (he's a billionaire for chrissake -- who becomes president for the $$?)
They can't fathom that, there are many people who have conservative parents or upbringing, and yet became liberals because /r/politics is not distorting information, it's linking to well-researched news articles by journalists. In the age of the internet, we can check and verify, the truthfulness of /r/politics, and yet these people are flat out saying "LIBERAL MEDIA"; one person in /r/askreddit, got downvoted for saying 'liberal media myth', and people accused him of liberal bias. Anything that doesn't fit their conservative worldview == liberal bias and thus false!
We're calling them "Low information voters" until the middle of November when it's okay to offend them again.
What I can't figure out -- and I've spoken to a number of teachers about it, and no one knows -- is who actually believes this bullshit.  Someone, somewhere, is making policy that no one can fail, that the tests are unfair, that if the material were just taught differently than every child would be smart.  But I don't know who these people are, or why they believe this way.  Hell, I can't even figure out who decided they should stop keeping score in softball; everyone acknowledges that it's bullshit, but that's just the way it's played now.
To be fair, what about all the black voters that came out in 2008 that never voted a day in their life? I do understand that it's a bit different coming from a minority group. On the other hand, I don't feel like the same voters would come out if it was someone like Herman Cain.
the polls are incredibly inaccurate. take this poll for instance, it's the only poll putting Romney ahead.
It's the same brain washing that keeps kids in at night and teaches them to brush their teeth, so let's not take that thought process TOO far.  It comes down to humans being limited in their abilities.  The spectrum is so wide, so vast that anyone wanting to cast a wide political net must first chose to generalized a possibly misleading message, and every political message needs a boogey-man.  When you look at the messages closely it's clear - Democrats blame the republicans, themselves and the past.  The republicans blame anyone but themselves at all costs, and they almost always blame the opponent as a part of their opening line, and then go on to vaguely offer a solution, to be explained and executed AFTER the republican is placed in office.  I'm not saying the democrats are being honest or informed in their description of the placed blame, but I am saying that when a kid comes up to you and blames everyone in the world but himself for the broken lamp, it's pretty clear what happened. Now in this scenario with a broken lamp, a kid with an excuse, and mom the results are clear, but what if this house is full of a LOT of other kids and some adults, but everyone gets equal votes?  That kid with the explanation of what went wrong simply has to speak more loudly and keep his story on track to convince enough OTHER kids that his story is true.  That is the simple method in which the republicans ensure the race will always be close these days, vague up the message to everyone, relying on how busy and uninformed people HAVE to be thanks to the limitations of humans in a drowning economy, and always blame the other guy no matter what.  The only thing that can bring down this type of play is an informed public, and so far we ain't gettin' that.
romnesia at it's finest

But it's totally true.  The money is in Washington.  And every President, Senator and Congressmen participates in the corruption.  Even your grand leader ___ (enter name here) is corrupt.  You want real change you need to understand that almost everything you learn in school is a lie to brainwash you into a system of slavery.  Once you know that to be true you can start re-learning the truths of the world and help wake up others.  The only way to change and be free is to educate everyone in what it means to be free.  Religion and Government are here to control you.  These elections mean nothing.  Whoever you vote for will not change things for the better for you, but only change things for the government by consolidation.  The govenment will get bigger and control more and more and make more laws.  And you will still be a worker.  The education system is here to indoctrinate you into thinking you can't survive without being someone's employee - IE: someones slave.  It's never about you being free to live without needing to be an employee.  You don't get taught to own your own land, farm and grow food for yourself.  It's always about you working for someone else, getting paid money to go to the store to buy their crap that you could have grown yourself.   Learn what Serfdom means.  Obama is for big corporations, war, wallstreet, and bailouts for bankers.  Romney is the same.  Make no mistake they are the same.  They want war and money and they don't give a damn about you.  They never did.  Grow up.
Gosh, it's almost like he's a Machiavellian, lying sack of shit.

Why are there still monkeys - We didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and monkeys have a common ancestor. Asking why are there still monkeys is like asking if you came from your cousin, why are your cousins still here -- it's nonsensical.
What humans have a problem in accepting, is the concept that the universe contains the physics that create time and space; it's impossible for us to really grasp the concept of something from nothing, or nothingness itself because we've never experienced nothing, or anything that has no external form.  *if you die and are nothing, the brain cannot reconcile that notion to anything its ever experienced; how can something like our conscious mind become nothing?  It's far easier to think that we are transformed into something else which allows our conscious mind to carry on to eternity (whatever that actually means).

Isn't it awful how that christian who wrote the thing equates homosexuality and pornography to murder and rape? Those are so unrelated it's not even funny, but obviously to a christian homosexuality or self pleasure is so reprehensible it's up there with violence. I would never equate violence (such as rape and murder) to love (be it hetero, homo, or solo)
I think you have it; it's pretty weak.  Look through the blog.  Seems to be Christian baiting.
Why does my cock fit into my hand so nicely if it's a sin to masturbate?

For what it's worth, I'm a Christian, and I'll give my two cents if anyone would be interested.  (if not, downvote oblivion here i come!)
If we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?  Um.  Well, I don't believe we did come from monkeys, so this is a moot question.  But assuming that I did not believe, according to my understanding of evolution, it's not so much that people came from monkeys, but rather that they shared a similar ancestor.
Yes I have.  I don't know if it's real or not, but to me and what I believe in, it changes nothing.

Someone incredibly familiar with the IEM here. It has nothing to do with corn futures. The reason it isn't regulated is because traders can only invest $500. Anything more than that and the CFTC would consider them a gambling house. Honestly, it is 100% betting on the election, but it's used for research and they don't make a profit, so the CFTC says it's cool.
On top of that, Nate Silver would seem to justify Reddit's bias.
I'm currently reading Nate Silver's book, and it's fascinating to see all of the different factors that must be aggregated to make these predictions.  Very interesting stuff.
The media likes to emphasize the popular vote because it's a lot closer than the electoral vote. If people think Obama has it all sewn up they might stop watching the circus.
This personalization has a really negative effect on how we are informed as citizens. Just by browsing Reddit, you'll passively reinforce particular existing views - and even radicalize them. Without any content to counter or challenge the things we want to see, Reddit essentially becomes an echo chamber. We hear what we already think because the website is personalized to us, and because we hear it again, we think it's right. This effect is vastly compounded if Reddit is your only source of news. Because there is no overarching content control, there is no pressure to supply the other side(s) to issues.
Every time I've posted something that's portrays Obama, Liz Warren, etc in a negative light (which always comes from a good source) it's not only not upvoted, it's actively downvoted by numerous people.
I would love a more neutral subreddit with stricter rules on fact checking and serious comments (no puns, lame jokes and other meaningless posts), because it's almost as bad as /r/athesim in there.
There is also an age component at play here.  Reddit's demographic skews toward liberalism.  It also skews heavily toward those who are just out of college or just starting out in careers, aren't making any money yet and feel powerless.  Those folks, by and large, aren't voting for Romney.
There was an article that went out last week that researched Romney's remark during the debate about the President's pension. Politifact looked into it and found out Obama's pension is set up through the Cayman islands with investments in China. It's also much larger than Romney's. This isn't necessarily the Presidents fault as it's a blind investment setup through Illinois but highly hypocritical of his administration to criticize Romney for the same thing.
I was hoping it would garner some actual discussion (and vitriol) but apparently the post just got largely ignored. I suspect it  would have been on the top of /r/politics for weeks if it was Romney. Honestly I think /r/politics should have it's name changed.
Except the point about American politics being shifted right still stands when you look globally comparing America to other Western nations. The point about a shift to the left does not exist when you look outside the US. Seems like one side has a bit more support for it's case.
Except it's not a point of view, it's a fact. In the "left" / "right" political spectrum the true far left would be your socialism/communism (and don't forget anarcho-syndicalist-communes, lol). In meaningful use of the political spectrum there's no confusion.
I think it's the vote system that fucks everything up. It's meant to be used to vote discussions to the top, but it's used to vote dissenting opinions out of existence. Downvoting things you don't personally agree with is not what the system is in place for, but that's sure as hell how it's used.
Rather, it's just "Their conditions are different.  Case closed.  The end.".
I've noticed the whole Romney-is-evil thing here as well, but what's more troubling to me about political discourse on Reddit is how conservatives as a whole are treated. Reading comments on r/politics, you'd think that there's absolutely no logical basis for a conservative ideology. Sure, I disagree with most of what the GOP currently stands for, but it's possible to agree with the party and be an intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate person. Reading Reddit, you don't get a sense of any of that.
Maybe, but since the start of the month Obama has the lead in 4 polls compared to Romney's 8. Most of these leads on both sides are within the margin of error, but still I'd say it's more likely to go for Romney.
However, polls always have a margin of error, and even that margin of error is not an absolute indicator due to the confidence margin or whatever the statistical term is. I.e. a poll can have a 4 point margin of error but a 1 in 20 chance of being off the mark anyways, I think it's called a p-value, I never actually had a class on it all.
Well, seeing as a ton of the posts from r/politics are just retarded blogs, and at least 50% of the posts are filled with top comments saying "this article is complete bullshit" with intelligent discussion as to why, and then the second or third top comment is "People need to see this and wake up! This country is being destroyed. We aren't free! Romney will destroy us all!" I think it's safe to say that we are incredibly distorted. Not that others aren't, but if you believe Reddit isn't a source with a huge democratic bias, you probably don't value facts that much when it comes to making up your mind about something.  The truth and lies that a news article is composed of is like a smoothie of propaganda, which is which is only distinguishable if you put in the time to check sources, reliability, and how much facts are stretched.
On the other hand it's very comfy to be around people whom you agree with, and it creates a nice, self-perpetuating bubble of smug arrogance (as in my post). It does not mean it's not true, but it can make yourself feel more important than you really are.
I also think there's an element of arrogance involved as well. In the sense that it's unacceptable to admit something as important as an American Election could be so one-sided and predictable. American pop culture is all about drama, drama, drama; and there's no drama in a predictable outcome.

Hi Mr Roberts! First I want to thank you for doing this AMA and also for being so brave and challenging the industry and it's BS console focused mindset. This project is one that I personally had given up on ever seeing and I believe it will have a massive impact on the future of gaming. I am very excited.
And an advice about translating the game in other languages if I may: Please keep the names of the cities, planets and other stuff in the original language. WoW made that mistake and it's really annoying and confusing with all the different names of the cities for example.
Will we be able to build as well as purchase? I don't mean in the RTS sense, but will we be able to establish our own base of operations, in the sense that it's not a ship, but a stationary base?
Also, IIRC, it's been stated that in engagements, 'slots' will be reserved for your friends to jump in and help. Does this mean it won't be a 'come and go as you please' universe or am I just mistaken, which I probably am. Already gonna buy, but this clarification would just get me all the more titalated. Thanks!
Or are you aiming at some other point in the spectrum?  I watched the S42 trailer many, many times, and the speeds and distances involved look similar to WCP, but I know it's very early stage and still a prototype tech demo.  Just wanted to know if the trailer is representative of the combat pacing you're aiming for.
First off, thank you for doing this AMA and the work you’ve done in the past. My questions focus primarily on some of the less space sim-y aspects of Star Citizen. I apologize if these questions have already been asked, it's hard to keep track of all the information. If you could answer just one or two I’d appreciate it.
This game seems ambitious on a scale we haven't seen before.  MMO/single/super detail/super fast/open ended it seems like it's tackling every angle at once.
-I feel like doing the 5$ = __ credits right away is removing the "I've earned this item because of my skills/time spent ingame". Do you think it's ahred amongst player, and if so, how are you going to solve that?
I was wondering if you were planning to implement TrackIR support. You're a PC man and I'm assuming you've heard of the device. I know it's not mega-popular, but it enahances the immersion in games in a way I can't even describe.
Also, how in-depth will customization go in the game? Will it only be "skin deep" with colors and such? I understand that the ships have a large number of modeled parts for realistic damage, but could we be provided with a modular custom ship creator? Say I save up a massive amount of money, could I build a custom Cruiser with a small landing bay in back for one or two fighters? Maybe there would be a buch of prefabricated rooms, engines, features and armament that I could arrange how I wanted and then give it it's armored skin over top to finish construction. Is this idea possible? Not possible? Why?
The original Wing Commander and it's sequels were hugely influential on my life.  I credit my career in IT directly with the skills and lessons I learned while learning how to make these games run properly on various computers over the years.
I just want to say, you are amazing!!! I am still playing freelancer (discovery mod) since its really the only space sim that gets it right. It has held up amazingly well for being such an old game, and I'm so excited for the improvements you're bringing to Star Citizen. As an engineer, the fly by wire system has me really excited! I absolutely cannot wait to play this game, and I'm even considering buying a dedicated gaming rig just to play it in all it's glory!

You forgot to put words over it. Reddit won't upvote comments like this unless it's a gif or reiterates the message on the picture.
"This guy is right, for once it's not a video or story about a girl being shot or raped, good on us, for once."
As it seems like none of my previous classmates are redditors I feel it's my duty to defend my school against some of the less constructive comments.
This is Witney M. Young high school and it's a magnet school in Chicago. Top 3 in the city, 4th in the state, and around 135 in the nation. It's pretty funny reading a bunch of comments about this "inner city" school, when in fact the majority of the students in that video are probably enrolled in AP classes and will receive offers of enrollment from some of the top universities in the country.
To be fair, it's not really reddit logic. It's the American middle-class suburb logic.
Haha thank you. Although I do provide some evidence in some of my replies to back up the claim that this school is supposed to be good. But I don't see how it's not believable that a video of kids being kids (not really kids) can come from a school with high test scores. No matter where you are, at the ages of 14–18 you're going to do ridiculous things and be rowdy. In fact, you probably know that in these schools no one really causes trouble, so that's why the teachers don't shut it down right away because they know it probably won't get too out of control despite how loud it is. I'm guessing within a minute after the video stopped, some high up faculty walks by, tells them to quiet down, and everyone goes back to being normal.
Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
What makes you think it's from the inner city?
If you serve someone back after getting served, then it's on.
Wait... so high school today really IS like it's portrayed in those stupid dance movies?
Just wait until you see their football games. It's not about football at all, it's just an opportunity for each school's marching band to compete with each other.
Oh it's on.
Oh...it's on!
but now it's on....

This is an MRI scan, so it's a cross sectional image.
Exactly. There's no doubt that one is bigger than the other but as far as comparisons go, you can't go in too much details since it's not the same cut.
Correct me if I'm wrong [edit: I am wrong, see /u/Mansy's comment below], but I don't think this isn't an MRI scan. I think it's images taken in a method akin to the Visible Human Project - literally images of frozen cadavers which are photographed cross-sectionally, then a layer is removed (destructively), a new photo taken and so on and so forth.
it's hard to see the plane in which these are taken, but I think those are eyes.
Being fat is unhealthy, same as smoking. We should ultimately respect people's decisions, but I don't see how it's unreasonable to suggest that overweight people lose some weight.
So it's farts.
Jesus the human heart is huge, it's weirding me out man
yeah, I once saw a scan of my chest and all I though was "damn, what the hell is this thing? it's freakin huge!" ... "oh, that's the heart?? :o"
it's all good, You left it on, but you also left the side door open, so I walked in and turned it off.
No, it's more than just that. Look at the muscle development on the interior side of the ankles, and the shape of the ankles themselves. Her disorders are related to more than just being overweight, although i'm sure it's adding additional strain and not improving her situation.
I know jack about MRIs but I'm guessing it's only because of how the MRI take's a 'slice'. It's probably the same reason why the arm bones aren't visible on each women, since they would be angled downwards while laying on a table
It is not healthy that fat people have larger hearts. It's the body's way of adapting to needing to supply more blood. When the heart does this, it is prone to heart-attacks and cardiovascular diseases. Being obese puts tremendous strain on the heart, so no, it's not healthy.
See, it's not bullying.
Yes, it's visceral fat (fat that surrounds the organs). It's very unhealthy to have a significant amount of visceral fat because your body faces a huge risk in heart problems, diabetes and various other health issues.
If it's a CT scan, dark areas are less dense.  You can usually tell if a person has gas by a black area in the stomach.  (disclaimer: I am not a radiologist).  If dark area was shit, then this person inhaled a ton of it into her lungs.
If it's a CT scan ... I suck at reading MRI's though.
No, it's just air. Unfortunately, you won't be able to say "Fat girls are full of shit, I've seen it!"
yeah, i have the same problem getting through doorways as well. not because i'm so large (since i'm 1% bodyfat) but because my dick is 36 inches long and always erect. it's very hard traversing through tight knit indoor environments and sharp turns when you have that much sway and inertia in your lower body.

Gaga has a pretty great voice, it's just not as unique as Adele's-
I think the music biz really is like this. Some guy thought that the "lady gaga" marketing campaign is what was needed. Was it? Would more people have liked her original image? No one can truly say. I think that the perception of the gatekeeper has much more to do with what is inflicted upon us than the reality of what people really like. I mean, it's not as if Adele needed to be marketed as Princess Delly or something with backup dancers in tow.
Yeah, except the whole child prodigy thing. I'm not a fan of her or her music but she apparently has some serious chops. Also pop music is meant to be superficial and vapid. Consequently it's also designed to make a lot of money as well. During every part of modern music there are people that hear whatever is popular and decry how it's leading to the decay of society. It's just not true. Jazz and Rock n' Roll were supposed to lead to the doom of the world, but that never happened. Basically you just shouldn't make sweeping generalizations like that based on the like 2 songs you heard from her.
As a competent guitar player, I'm at the point where I don't like certain players because of the knowledge that being a musician imparts to me. For me one of these players is Slash. As a rock band, G'n'R is pretty great, but I can't just listen to them without analyzing Slash's playing. It sounds good, but it's not great in the guitar realm. When my relatives found out I was a guitar player they all seemed to jump on the "play me Sweet Child" bandwagon but when I explained that I didn't know it because I didn't like Slash, their response was akin to "shut up, he's famous and you're not, so he's done something right."
Meanwhile I was studying SRV, BB King, Townshend, and Hendrix who are arguably more important to rock than Slash. Can you see the disconnect here? It's not even a matter of talent unless the "victim" (for lack of a better word) is going around saying how much better they are than x or y; it's usually a matter of taste.
Let's be honest...lyrically and musically speaking it's all been done before and pretty much half the insane bullshit she does was done by Madonna before her.
oh hey look it's a normal hot person
Oh ok so because you like Bowies music more, so it's ok for him to act weird
the reason she became famous was because of her standing out. She HAD to stand out against the competition, otherwise no one would hear her, she was just another "aspiring" musician. Now, she's a somebody. She has a name. She can be normal if she wants to, but I think she enjoys being OTT, she knows it's working, she makes the headlines with every new outfit she comes up with. Plus, it must be fantastic to be a celebrity and have NO ONE recodnise you out of your "image" :)

I definitely understand where you're coming from and I appreciate the sentiment. I just feel sad when I look at myself and don't see what I would like. I've gotten over any embarrassment with regards to what others think. I'd really like to just be happy with what I have, and most of the time it's not on my mind at all, but if I'm being honest I'd love to fill in shirts and dresses better, not bust out of them, but just fit properly so they aren't hanging off of me. I hate clothes shopping and that's a big part of why, nothing is really designed for flat girls. Not in my income range anyway.
it's ok. small chested girls make me have a sad too.
It's probably because for her, it's about what she likes, not about what you do.
I don't think it's what she likes.  I think it's what she thinks that the world likes.
That's not a good thing. It's like saying, "Your breasts are so small, it's just like you had breast cancer and got them removed!"
Next time my girlfriend complains about her boobs I'll let her know that it's OK, at least she can wear suspenders.
Not that it's really the same thing but that's like telling a fat person "don't worry there's a ton of people who have fat fetishes!"
Obviously having small boobs is commonly more preferred than being fat but it's still not a super conforming sentiment.
Yeah, the way I see it.......okay, it's nice that you and others like small boobs, that people find them attractive. But I don't. And I'm the one who has to live with 'em.
Definitely still need a sports bra - though you're right that it's probably no where near as uncomfortable. They still bounce a little bit.
Not that I play golf but I've heard that it's also easier with small breasts.

It seems like it's always 8/10
It's not really that we have a monopoly on Reddit's advertising system, it's just that there are not a lot of advertisers on Reddit in general. We actually pay the minimum amount required per day to advertise ($30 per subreddit), and are usually competing with a few different ads each day. Redditors love the site, the 5K+ upvotes and comments are all legit (as krispykrackers confirmed above), and this ad brings us a ton of new visitors, so it's worthwhile for us to keep this ad running every day.
It's because it's the same thread being promoted, those are the same comments you see everytime.

"Apelsin - Kolsyrad läskedryck" Basically means that it's orange flavored carbonated soda.
Not that anyone would likely crack it open and drink it... but if it's been in storage for roughly as long as it is old without severe agitation, all the syrup and additives have come out of suspension... the top part is all carbonated water, and the lower part is all syrup and coloring.
I cracked a Pepsi from dad's cupboard and realized that the soda was bland-- thought, "oh... it's just caffeine free... and flavor free."  So I poured it in the sink and it came out clear followed by brown sludge.
There is a protective liner along the inside of the can, protecting the metal from the liquid, however it is easily punctured, particularly if the can has ever been dented (either by you or somewhere along the process shipping from the factory to the store). Once that happens, it's not a question of if but when it will begin to leak everywhere and destroy everything you hold dear.

Your park rating will drop, but it's oh so fun.
It was one of those deals where they released almost the exact same game but with a few minor changes and called it '2'. There are new rides and things, it's more or less an expansion park.
The only really notable difference is that you could stack scenery. In the first one you could only build little walls on the grass, but once you are able to stack scenery, you can work upward too, so it allowed you to build little houses and things, with roofs and that. This made little difference to the game, but once the modding community got hold of it, they made their own scenery, and used this new stacking ability to make incredibly complex structures and things. Just take a look at the links I provided, it's amazing, but still so time consuming; each piece on each square is placed by hand.
But you're forgetting it's called Universe Sandbox.

Actually, it's >7 billion now.
Every 150 minutes there is 1 year of video uploaded, that is INCREDIBLE. My mind is blown just trying to comprehend consuming that much content and it's uploaded EVERY 150 minutes!
Reddit isn't useful to me because it's a link aggregator or a forum. It's useful because it's a scalable and universal system for screening content, from videos to products to music or fashion. Google has spent the last few years trying to tackle "social search." Reddit ended up doing by accident.
With inflation it's more like over 9.86 based on this huffpost article.
The problem that drives reposts isn't a lack of content - it's a lack of good content, and good ways to separate the good from the bad. The reason we get reposts is that they've already gotten past the "is this good or bad?" filter, and so can be depended on. If good content is a needle in a stack of shit, then reposts are all those needles that have been painstakingly grabbed from the shit and already set aside.
If you filter out videos of cats and crap lets plays, it's about 30 minutes.
This is strongly in line with the lifestyle of it's founder and CEO, Tristam Shandy.

Ya know sometimes, as a parent, it's just better to let your kid not eat their peas and green beans if they don't want to.
Because parents are supposed to be proud when their children kill or die for their country, not when they speak up when it's illegal or may offend people.
the speaking up I can deal with it's their right as humans to do so, the breaking and entering, destruction of property and assault I cannot.
It's an acceptable form of justice as far as I'm concerned since it's not changing the law it's just bending it so it doesn't create any dangerous precedents (i.e. they would of been charged with what they were charged with regardless but likely wouldn't of gotten anywhere near the max sentence if it wasn't for all this other stuff I'm guessing).
No. Tolokonnikova was one of the founders and leaders, not simply a member. Samutsevich was one of the other members of Voina as you can see from their video and photo reports. As for other two pussy riot members (one of which wasn't caught), it's not clear at all, since neither group has listed their membership for their own safety sake.
Because it's a horrible travesty to the values of the civilized and democratic world, which Russia half-heartedly pretends to be a part of.
I was born in the Soviet Union, and I guess it's clear why the West abandoned us after World War 2.
They're not progressive. They have never fought for anything in their lives. They're a typical US shopper/worker with a cozy priviliged life. In a bubble like that it's difficult to understand.
You're right, but as I said a few times now, it's almost guaranteed that their previous criminal history comes into consideration when a sentence is being handed down hence the 2 years they received.
Fun fact: there's a purposefully funny Russian dub of the Lord of the Rings, and Mordor becomes Mordovia, Gondor becomes Honduras, etc. In Russian it's hilarious.
I'm glad to have more facts, glad to have read the article. But I found it grating that the author emphasized what the facilities used to be used for by a different government. I get the symbolism here. The right way to handle this is to point out the symbolism and then report accurately about the current conditions at these facilities. Propaganda bothers me, even when it's for "my side."
This may be true, but to put bullshit quoted by them in the headline in such a way will make it seem like it's the truth.  Such a line should be in the article, and it should be followed with a debunking, but it shouldn't be the headline, as that will mislead people and the media knows this.
... but it's for their "singing", and not their activism, so it's completely justified.
that raises the question about the legitimacy of the protest, not the power => it's counterproductive

Use sacrificial drone comb - make absolutely sure it's removed while brood still capped
Interesting other issue are bats are coming down with the white nose syndrome (fungus) which is killing them off. They eat insects, and it's entirely possible that not only are we killing insects but in turn we are killing the animals that eat insects, too.
Maybe it's just me but I never really understood why people thought it was a great idea to spray poison all over and why they are surprised when it kills things. I mean, it doesn't take "human poison" to kill me - could be rat poison, could be weed poison, could be bug poison. Likewise with other life forms.
That's not what I meant, I guess I was unclear. What I meant is that it's unsurprising to me that pesticide and herbicide causes massive "collateral damage" to bees, seeing as how pesticide and herbicide at those levels would cause the same damage to most animals.
Sorry, I guess my comment was unclear. What I mean is that since obviously we spend some effort checking crops to make sure that the very small levels of residual pesticide/herbicide do not harm humans, it's utterly unsurprising that much higher levels of pesticide and herbicide harm bees.
Those insects become resistant to that pesticide (or it's found to be too toxic) and they stop it's use, and use something else.  And the cycle repeats.
someone finds a new article, or a new article finds old research.  And every time informed people groan because it's fairly well established as a bunch of causes, and pesticides aren't necessarily even a top one.
This research is important and novel because it's replicating field-level exposures on bumblebee colonies of two pesticides (a neonicitinoid and a pyrethroid) in combination as well as individually, this hasn't been done before.
Heck it's one of the reasons GM foods are so important. Because the current nuke spray effect of pesticides is far more harmful then the controlled levels plants naturally produce, and if we can replicate nature, it'll probably be better for everyone.
I don't think news articles paint the picture right.  There's company involvement all over the place, but most farms, in the states I have lived in, are actually owned and operated by farmers, then they give their crops to a pool/company that distributes.  If a company owns a farm, it's a company started by the family that started the farm.  I have two grandmothers that own a substantial amount of family farms, which act as their retirement income.  The farm is still mostly operated by family members though.
So since Agent Orange is a defoliant it's safe to eat.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11vz4g/amazon_closes_womans_account_and_wipes_her_kindle/
According to this interview with Linn, it appears that she bought her first Kindle used,  so it's not entirely inconceivable that it's related to the account tied to the previous owner of that Kindle.
I should add that in addition to emailing, I did call, several times. While it's hard to say if it helped, it was definitely more helpful than emailing.
I only got back a really surley fuck you type message. So then I inquired again politely and got the same shitty response back. Took the gloves off and, without any actual threats, etc mind you, just a bit of a tyraid on how they could treat their customers this way it's not right, etc etc, some tech emails me back saying I'm being threatening and has called the cops on me.
Amazon is now going to release a statement explaining what happened, and it's going to turn out that this woman's Credit Card information has been used in multiple other accounts and Amazon was basically just shutting down all the accounts so that card can't be used anymore on their site.
THAT SAID, how Amazon's handling this is bullshit and they should absolutely be providing her with enough information to know exactly what's going on.  Plus, of course, it's rather troubling to think that your Kindle and everything you purchased for it could be wiped out entirely at the whim of Amazon, with no recourse besides legal action.
Either way, while I'm not saying it's impossible this is 100% an error on Amazon's part, I'm still guessing there's more to the story on the customer's end than we're hearing.
I had a similar problem with Amazon, I think for them it's par for the course to not provide any details why they close an account. I tried calling them a few times - at one time one of the customer reps said that there was no problem with my account, but with an account from a customer in another city who has the same name as I do. (Fine, I have an relatively unusual name, but not that unusual. And really - the credit card details say where I live, so why is that an issue?)
In my experience it's fairly typical for large companies not to provide details in cases which are related to some kind of account fraud or related abuse. The more details they make available, the more vulnerable their detection tech is to gaming by scammers.
It's pretty baffling all around, so don't think I'm defending Amazon TOO much here.  I'm just saying, it's still safe to assume that companies have a purpose to their actions, at least most of the time.
With that said, this post is disturbing.  Regardless of whether she did or didn't do something wrong, or Amazon simply made a mistake, it's not good that we're headed in a direction where large corporations "own" what you "buy" and have the ability to repossess or destroy it with no explanation, no due process and no viable recourse.
I'm sure I've used terms like "purchased" to describe digital media before. I just wanted to use this opportunity to point out the distinction to people who might not otherwise know about it, because it's very relevant to the discussion at hand.
That's probably the most sensible idea. If she lost enough to be worth her time then she should at least contact the amazon legal department and say if it's not sorted out then she will take legal action.
See, the problem is, when I see Amazon could suspend my account by mistake and deny me access to the stuff I bought from them, not tell me why or otherwise try to help fix the mistake, and my only recourse would be to get a lawyer and perhaps go to court, as a potential customer it just doesn't make me want to do business with them. It's too risky and complicated. And it's their loss more than it is mine.
Digital media with restrictions like this should be treated for what they are: rentals. As such, they are only deserving of a rental's price. This is why I never spend more than $10 for a Steam game, or $1-2 for an eBook. If it's not mine, then it's still the seller's, in which case they don't deserve full price for it.
Interestingly enough, only Apple has thus far actually moved to a model embracing technology's strengths without the inane restrictions, but even there it's only with music (and still limited to lossy formats).
This. Also, it's not Amazon deciding on whether an e-book should have DRM or not, it's the publishers. Amazon's actually been fighting a huge legal battle against the publishers, in behalf of their customers to prevent the fucked-up pricing that's been happening (e-books costing as much, and sometimes more than the hard cover version).
The point here isn't who caused the problem, the point here is that Amazon isn't even trying to help this customer fix it. The worst part, for me, is where they stated that "any subsequent account" would be closed as well. What the actual fuck? This is essentially banning the person altogether. I don't think it's wrong to terminate the account of someone who broke the rules, but to keep terminating any new accounts after they've learned a lesson? That's just mean and hostile. And especially so if you refuse to tell the person why you banned them to begin with.
It's shitty, but well within the terms of service, and it's something people should be aware of before they tie so much of their life/purchases to an account that could be closed on a whim.
The problem is when problems occur which the customer service agent in India isn't capable of solving.  This is when you see the beautiful surface of Amazon peel away and what's left is a rotten core of cold heartless automation, the Hades of customer service.  By definition you will get absolutely no assistance here because it's completely devoid of human thought or compassion; again, Amazon is built to ignore the most time consuming customers.  They don't want you, and thus your complaints will be met with mindless form emails until you give up and leave.  Amazon: 1, Annoying Customer: 0.
Believe it or not, I still shop at Amazon because their shopping system is far and away the best.  And if something goes wrong I'm sure I can usually get a decent remedy.  But I have no illusions about the way the company works behind the scenes.  I hope nobody here personally has to deal with Amazon on the same level I did, because it's hell.
No, but it's how many businesses behave as soon as there is the slightest whiff of something that interests the "security" department.
It's usually an issue of some dipshit who loves the power they have to close accounts and goes overboard in assuming somethings bad or fishy when it's not. Once these folks close accounts, it usually took someone higher up like me to MAKE them understand they did a bad thing and open the account back up. Even then, they would smirk and say they weren't wrong. It was absurd.
E: Looks like the Internet killed the blog site. Basically it's someone saying Amazon killed his friend's account and remotely wiped her Kindle because the account was 'related to an existing closed account', and in the following email chain tells her any future accounts will also be closed and refuses to tell her any further details and ends with "we're not going to discuss the matter further" and "thank you for understanding our decision"
Yeah, I mean it's not like they are playing fair. It's a capitalist system, it pays off to be an opportunist, they take advantages of the system and it's fine. But when your avarage Joe does it, it is wrong?
I also don't like this weird digital-age notion content producers have that they can take back what they sold you. If a copy of a file on your computer is considered an "item" (as they insist it is when pirates "publish" millions of copies), and you've bought it, then it's theft for them to take it back. Imagine if publishers (or recording studios, or movie studios) were allowed to walk into your home and box up your books, movies, and DVDs. I would call the goddamn cops on them, and they would go to jail, because that's theft.
She probably violated some form of terms or contract a person does when registering their product. Rarely happens, except they took action. They may not be informing her of her breach do to reason of pursuing other activity related to her account. Although not fair it's my game plan if I was Amazon. Possible she was taking copywritten material and posting that data elsewhere. Uploading to torrents. Honestly a little extreme.

What wouldn't surprise me is hearing something equivalent from Obama. After 3 thankless years of trying to turn around problems he didn't create, while taking all the blame for it, he's still out there campaigning and trying to do the job again. Fucking amazing that he isn't up there going "Hey Romney it's all yours. Good luck, buddy. I'm going to go sit on a beach and watch the world burn."
He's saying the salesman needs to make more money for his family for when he dies. I mean it's either cars or blue meth.
That's because it's been conveniently left out of the media narrative.
Mitt Romney was born in 1947, meaning he would have been 19 in 1966. Age 19 is exactly in the age range where every male member of the LDS church goes on a mission. It's not "convenient", it's just how LDS missions work.
Former Mormon here, not every 19 year old boy goes on a mission, it's a choice. So he clearly chose to do that while avoiding the draft. There were plenty of men that chose the opposite even though they were Mormon 19 year olds.
The problem isn't just in the federal government as an organism, it's in individual government officials that have no integrity.
Unfortunately, there are enough people out there who take religion seriously enough that it's not very pragmatic to mock them in public.  It's not like you have to fall back on his religion to make Romney look ridiculous, anyway.
I think it's more that the title it's without context rather than being misleading. The title just quotes Romney.  I didn't interpret that to mean he running to make money at all (he's a billionaire for chrissake -- who becomes president for the $$?)
They can't fathom that, there are many people who have conservative parents or upbringing, and yet became liberals because /r/politics is not distorting information, it's linking to well-researched news articles by journalists. In the age of the internet, we can check and verify, the truthfulness of /r/politics, and yet these people are flat out saying "LIBERAL MEDIA"; one person in /r/askreddit, got downvoted for saying 'liberal media myth', and people accused him of liberal bias. Anything that doesn't fit their conservative worldview == liberal bias and thus false!
We're calling them "Low information voters" until the middle of November when it's okay to offend them again.
What I can't figure out -- and I've spoken to a number of teachers about it, and no one knows -- is who actually believes this bullshit.  Someone, somewhere, is making policy that no one can fail, that the tests are unfair, that if the material were just taught differently than every child would be smart.  But I don't know who these people are, or why they believe this way.  Hell, I can't even figure out who decided they should stop keeping score in softball; everyone acknowledges that it's bullshit, but that's just the way it's played now.
To be fair, what about all the black voters that came out in 2008 that never voted a day in their life? I do understand that it's a bit different coming from a minority group. On the other hand, I don't feel like the same voters would come out if it was someone like Herman Cain.
the polls are incredibly inaccurate. take this poll for instance, it's the only poll putting Romney ahead.
It's the same brain washing that keeps kids in at night and teaches them to brush their teeth, so let's not take that thought process TOO far.  It comes down to humans being limited in their abilities.  The spectrum is so wide, so vast that anyone wanting to cast a wide political net must first chose to generalized a possibly misleading message, and every political message needs a boogey-man.  When you look at the messages closely it's clear - Democrats blame the republicans, themselves and the past.  The republicans blame anyone but themselves at all costs, and they almost always blame the opponent as a part of their opening line, and then go on to vaguely offer a solution, to be explained and executed AFTER the republican is placed in office.  I'm not saying the democrats are being honest or informed in their description of the placed blame, but I am saying that when a kid comes up to you and blames everyone in the world but himself for the broken lamp, it's pretty clear what happened. Now in this scenario with a broken lamp, a kid with an excuse, and mom the results are clear, but what if this house is full of a LOT of other kids and some adults, but everyone gets equal votes?  That kid with the explanation of what went wrong simply has to speak more loudly and keep his story on track to convince enough OTHER kids that his story is true.  That is the simple method in which the republicans ensure the race will always be close these days, vague up the message to everyone, relying on how busy and uninformed people HAVE to be thanks to the limitations of humans in a drowning economy, and always blame the other guy no matter what.  The only thing that can bring down this type of play is an informed public, and so far we ain't gettin' that.
romnesia at it's finest
yes, it's positively damning...yawn
But it's totally true.  The money is in Washington.  And every President, Senator and Congressmen participates in the corruption.  Even your grand leader ___ (enter name here) is corrupt.  You want real change you need to understand that almost everything you learn in school is a lie to brainwash you into a system of slavery.  Once you know that to be true you can start re-learning the truths of the world and help wake up others.  The only way to change and be free is to educate everyone in what it means to be free.  Religion and Government are here to control you.  These elections mean nothing.  Whoever you vote for will not change things for the better for you, but only change things for the government by consolidation.  The govenment will get bigger and control more and more and make more laws.  And you will still be a worker.  The education system is here to indoctrinate you into thinking you can't survive without being someone's employee - IE: someones slave.  It's never about you being free to live without needing to be an employee.  You don't get taught to own your own land, farm and grow food for yourself.  It's always about you working for someone else, getting paid money to go to the store to buy their crap that you could have grown yourself.   Learn what Serfdom means.  Obama is for big corporations, war, wallstreet, and bailouts for bankers.  Romney is the same.  Make no mistake they are the same.  They want war and money and they don't give a damn about you.  They never did.  Grow up.
Gosh, it's almost like he's a Machiavellian, lying sack of shit.

Why are there still monkeys - We didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and monkeys have a common ancestor. Asking why are there still monkeys is like asking if you came from your cousin, why are your cousins still here -- it's nonsensical.
What humans have a problem in accepting, is the concept that the universe contains the physics that create time and space; it's impossible for us to really grasp the concept of something from nothing, or nothingness itself because we've never experienced nothing, or anything that has no external form.  *if you die and are nothing, the brain cannot reconcile that notion to anything its ever experienced; how can something like our conscious mind become nothing?  It's far easier to think that we are transformed into something else which allows our conscious mind to carry on to eternity (whatever that actually means).
{...}Grand Canyon form? the force of Colorado river. Ever been there? you should, it's an amazing place.
Isn't it awful how that christian who wrote the thing equates homosexuality and pornography to murder and rape? Those are so unrelated it's not even funny, but obviously to a christian homosexuality or self pleasure is so reprehensible it's up there with violence. I would never equate violence (such as rape and murder) to love (be it hetero, homo, or solo)
I think you have it; it's pretty weak.  Look through the blog.  Seems to be Christian baiting.
Why does my cock fit into my hand so nicely if it's a sin to masturbate?

For what it's worth, I'm a Christian, and I'll give my two cents if anyone would be interested.  (if not, downvote oblivion here i come!)
If we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?  Um.  Well, I don't believe we did come from monkeys, so this is a moot question.  But assuming that I did not believe, according to my understanding of evolution, it's not so much that people came from monkeys, but rather that they shared a similar ancestor.
Yes I have.  I don't know if it's real or not, but to me and what I believe in, it changes nothing.

Someone incredibly familiar with the IEM here. It has nothing to do with corn futures. The reason it isn't regulated is because traders can only invest $500. Anything more than that and the CFTC would consider them a gambling house. Honestly, it is 100% betting on the election, but it's used for research and they don't make a profit, so the CFTC says it's cool.
On top of that, Nate Silver would seem to justify Reddit's bias.
I'm currently reading Nate Silver's book, and it's fascinating to see all of the different factors that must be aggregated to make these predictions.  Very interesting stuff.
The media likes to emphasize the popular vote because it's a lot closer than the electoral vote. If people think Obama has it all sewn up they might stop watching the circus.
This personalization has a really negative effect on how we are informed as citizens. Just by browsing Reddit, you'll passively reinforce particular existing views - and even radicalize them. Without any content to counter or challenge the things we want to see, Reddit essentially becomes an echo chamber. We hear what we already think because the website is personalized to us, and because we hear it again, we think it's right. This effect is vastly compounded if Reddit is your only source of news. Because there is no overarching content control, there is no pressure to supply the other side(s) to issues.
Every time I've posted something that's portrays Obama, Liz Warren, etc in a negative light (which always comes from a good source) it's not only not upvoted, it's actively downvoted by numerous people.
I would love a more neutral subreddit with stricter rules on fact checking and serious comments (no puns, lame jokes and other meaningless posts), because it's almost as bad as /r/athesim in there.
There is also an age component at play here.  Reddit's demographic skews toward liberalism.  It also skews heavily toward those who are just out of college or just starting out in careers, aren't making any money yet and feel powerless.  Those folks, by and large, aren't voting for Romney.
There was an article that went out last week that researched Romney's remark during the debate about the President's pension. Politifact looked into it and found out Obama's pension is set up through the Cayman islands with investments in China. It's also much larger than Romney's. This isn't necessarily the Presidents fault as it's a blind investment setup through Illinois but highly hypocritical of his administration to criticize Romney for the same thing.
I was hoping it would garner some actual discussion (and vitriol) but apparently the post just got largely ignored. I suspect it  would have been on the top of /r/politics for weeks if it was Romney. Honestly I think /r/politics should have it's name changed.
Except the point about American politics being shifted right still stands when you look globally comparing America to other Western nations. The point about a shift to the left does not exist when you look outside the US. Seems like one side has a bit more support for it's case.
Except it's not a point of view, it's a fact. In the "left" / "right" political spectrum the true far left would be your socialism/communism (and don't forget anarcho-syndicalist-communes, lol). In meaningful use of the political spectrum there's no confusion.
I think it's the vote system that fucks everything up. It's meant to be used to vote discussions to the top, but it's used to vote dissenting opinions out of existence. Downvoting things you don't personally agree with is not what the system is in place for, but that's sure as hell how it's used.
Rather, it's just "Their conditions are different.  Case closed.  The end.".
I've noticed the whole Romney-is-evil thing here as well, but what's more troubling to me about political discourse on Reddit is how conservatives as a whole are treated. Reading comments on r/politics, you'd think that there's absolutely no logical basis for a conservative ideology. Sure, I disagree with most of what the GOP currently stands for, but it's possible to agree with the party and be an intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate person. Reading Reddit, you don't get a sense of any of that.
Maybe, but since the start of the month Obama has the lead in 4 polls compared to Romney's 8. Most of these leads on both sides are within the margin of error, but still I'd say it's more likely to go for Romney.
However, polls always have a margin of error, and even that margin of error is not an absolute indicator due to the confidence margin or whatever the statistical term is. I.e. a poll can have a 4 point margin of error but a 1 in 20 chance of being off the mark anyways, I think it's called a p-value, I never actually had a class on it all.
Well, seeing as a ton of the posts from r/politics are just retarded blogs, and at least 50% of the posts are filled with top comments saying "this article is complete bullshit" with intelligent discussion as to why, and then the second or third top comment is "People need to see this and wake up! This country is being destroyed. We aren't free! Romney will destroy us all!" I think it's safe to say that we are incredibly distorted. Not that others aren't, but if you believe Reddit isn't a source with a huge democratic bias, you probably don't value facts that much when it comes to making up your mind about something.  The truth and lies that a news article is composed of is like a smoothie of propaganda, which is which is only distinguishable if you put in the time to check sources, reliability, and how much facts are stretched.
On the other hand it's very comfy to be around people whom you agree with, and it creates a nice, self-perpetuating bubble of smug arrogance (as in my post). It does not mean it's not true, but it can make yourself feel more important than you really are.
I also think there's an element of arrogance involved as well. In the sense that it's unacceptable to admit something as important as an American Election could be so one-sided and predictable. American pop culture is all about drama, drama, drama; and there's no drama in a predictable outcome.

Hi Mr Roberts! First I want to thank you for doing this AMA and also for being so brave and challenging the industry and it's BS console focused mindset. This project is one that I personally had given up on ever seeing and I believe it will have a massive impact on the future of gaming. I am very excited.
And an advice about translating the game in other languages if I may: Please keep the names of the cities, planets and other stuff in the original language. WoW made that mistake and it's really annoying and confusing with all the different names of the cities for example.
Will we be able to build as well as purchase? I don't mean in the RTS sense, but will we be able to establish our own base of operations, in the sense that it's not a ship, but a stationary base?
Also, IIRC, it's been stated that in engagements, 'slots' will be reserved for your friends to jump in and help. Does this mean it won't be a 'come and go as you please' universe or am I just mistaken, which I probably am. Already gonna buy, but this clarification would just get me all the more titalated. Thanks!
Or are you aiming at some other point in the spectrum?  I watched the S42 trailer many, many times, and the speeds and distances involved look similar to WCP, but I know it's very early stage and still a prototype tech demo.  Just wanted to know if the trailer is representative of the combat pacing you're aiming for.
First off, thank you for doing this AMA and the work you’ve done in the past. My questions focus primarily on some of the less space sim-y aspects of Star Citizen. I apologize if these questions have already been asked, it's hard to keep track of all the information. If you could answer just one or two I’d appreciate it.
This game seems ambitious on a scale we haven't seen before.  MMO/single/super detail/super fast/open ended it seems like it's tackling every angle at once.
-I feel like doing the 5$ = __ credits right away is removing the "I've earned this item because of my skills/time spent ingame". Do you think it's ahred amongst player, and if so, how are you going to solve that?
I was wondering if you were planning to implement TrackIR support. You're a PC man and I'm assuming you've heard of the device. I know it's not mega-popular, but it enahances the immersion in games in a way I can't even describe.
Also, how in-depth will customization go in the game? Will it only be "skin deep" with colors and such? I understand that the ships have a large number of modeled parts for realistic damage, but could we be provided with a modular custom ship creator? Say I save up a massive amount of money, could I build a custom Cruiser with a small landing bay in back for one or two fighters? Maybe there would be a buch of prefabricated rooms, engines, features and armament that I could arrange how I wanted and then give it it's armored skin over top to finish construction. Is this idea possible? Not possible? Why?
The original Wing Commander and it's sequels were hugely influential on my life.  I credit my career in IT directly with the skills and lessons I learned while learning how to make these games run properly on various computers over the years.
I just want to say, you are amazing!!! I am still playing freelancer (discovery mod) since its really the only space sim that gets it right. It has held up amazingly well for being such an old game, and I'm so excited for the improvements you're bringing to Star Citizen. As an engineer, the fly by wire system has me really excited! I absolutely cannot wait to play this game, and I'm even considering buying a dedicated gaming rig just to play it in all it's glory!

You forgot to put words over it. Reddit won't upvote comments like this unless it's a gif or reiterates the message on the picture.
"This guy is right, for once it's not a video or story about a girl being shot or raped, good on us, for once."
As it seems like none of my previous classmates are redditors I feel it's my duty to defend my school against some of the less constructive comments.
This is Witney M. Young high school and it's a magnet school in Chicago. Top 3 in the city, 4th in the state, and around 135 in the nation. It's pretty funny reading a bunch of comments about this "inner city" school, when in fact the majority of the students in that video are probably enrolled in AP classes and will receive offers of enrollment from some of the top universities in the country.
To be fair, it's not really reddit logic. It's the American middle-class suburb logic.
Haha thank you. Although I do provide some evidence in some of my replies to back up the claim that this school is supposed to be good. But I don't see how it's not believable that a video of kids being kids (not really kids) can come from a school with high test scores. No matter where you are, at the ages of 14–18 you're going to do ridiculous things and be rowdy. In fact, you probably know that in these schools no one really causes trouble, so that's why the teachers don't shut it down right away because they know it probably won't get too out of control despite how loud it is. I'm guessing within a minute after the video stopped, some high up faculty walks by, tells them to quiet down, and everyone goes back to being normal.
Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
What makes you think it's from the inner city?
If you serve someone back after getting served, then it's on.
Wait... so high school today really IS like it's portrayed in those stupid dance movies?
Just wait until you see their football games. It's not about football at all, it's just an opportunity for each school's marching band to compete with each other.
Oh it's on.
Oh...it's on!
but now it's on....

This is an MRI scan, so it's a cross sectional image.
Exactly. There's no doubt that one is bigger than the other but as far as comparisons go, you can't go in too much details since it's not the same cut.
Correct me if I'm wrong [edit: I am wrong, see /u/Mansy's comment below], but I don't think this isn't an MRI scan. I think it's images taken in a method akin to the Visible Human Project - literally images of frozen cadavers which are photographed cross-sectionally, then a layer is removed (destructively), a new photo taken and so on and so forth.
it's hard to see the plane in which these are taken, but I think those are eyes.
Being fat is unhealthy, same as smoking. We should ultimately respect people's decisions, but I don't see how it's unreasonable to suggest that overweight people lose some weight.
So it's farts.
Jesus the human heart is huge, it's weirding me out man
yeah, I once saw a scan of my chest and all I though was "damn, what the hell is this thing? it's freakin huge!" ... "oh, that's the heart?? :o"
it's all good, You left it on, but you also left the side door open, so I walked in and turned it off.
No, it's more than just that. Look at the muscle development on the interior side of the ankles, and the shape of the ankles themselves. Her disorders are related to more than just being overweight, although i'm sure it's adding additional strain and not improving her situation.
I know jack about MRIs but I'm guessing it's only because of how the MRI take's a 'slice'. It's probably the same reason why the arm bones aren't visible on each women, since they would be angled downwards while laying on a table
It is not healthy that fat people have larger hearts. It's the body's way of adapting to needing to supply more blood. When the heart does this, it is prone to heart-attacks and cardiovascular diseases. Being obese puts tremendous strain on the heart, so no, it's not healthy.
See, it's not bullying.
Yes, it's visceral fat (fat that surrounds the organs). It's very unhealthy to have a significant amount of visceral fat because your body faces a huge risk in heart problems, diabetes and various other health issues.
If it's a CT scan, dark areas are less dense.  You can usually tell if a person has gas by a black area in the stomach.  (disclaimer: I am not a radiologist).  If dark area was shit, then this person inhaled a ton of it into her lungs.
If it's a CT scan ... I suck at reading MRI's though.
No, it's just air. Unfortunately, you won't be able to say "Fat girls are full of shit, I've seen it!"
yeah, i have the same problem getting through doorways as well. not because i'm so large (since i'm 1% bodyfat) but because my dick is 36 inches long and always erect. it's very hard traversing through tight knit indoor environments and sharp turns when you have that much sway and inertia in your lower body.

Gaga has a pretty great voice, it's just not as unique as Adele's-
I think the music biz really is like this. Some guy thought that the "lady gaga" marketing campaign is what was needed. Was it? Would more people have liked her original image? No one can truly say. I think that the perception of the gatekeeper has much more to do with what is inflicted upon us than the reality of what people really like. I mean, it's not as if Adele needed to be marketed as Princess Delly or something with backup dancers in tow.
Yeah, except the whole child prodigy thing. I'm not a fan of her or her music but she apparently has some serious chops. Also pop music is meant to be superficial and vapid. Consequently it's also designed to make a lot of money as well. During every part of modern music there are people that hear whatever is popular and decry how it's leading to the decay of society. It's just not true. Jazz and Rock n' Roll were supposed to lead to the doom of the world, but that never happened. Basically you just shouldn't make sweeping generalizations like that based on the like 2 songs you heard from her.
As a competent guitar player, I'm at the point where I don't like certain players because of the knowledge that being a musician imparts to me. For me one of these players is Slash. As a rock band, G'n'R is pretty great, but I can't just listen to them without analyzing Slash's playing. It sounds good, but it's not great in the guitar realm. When my relatives found out I was a guitar player they all seemed to jump on the "play me Sweet Child" bandwagon but when I explained that I didn't know it because I didn't like Slash, their response was akin to "shut up, he's famous and you're not, so he's done something right."
Meanwhile I was studying SRV, BB King, Townshend, and Hendrix who are arguably more important to rock than Slash. Can you see the disconnect here? It's not even a matter of talent unless the "victim" (for lack of a better word) is going around saying how much better they are than x or y; it's usually a matter of taste.
Let's be honest...lyrically and musically speaking it's all been done before and pretty much half the insane bullshit she does was done by Madonna before her.
oh hey look it's a normal hot person
Oh ok so because you like Bowies music more, so it's ok for him to act weird
the reason she became famous was because of her standing out. She HAD to stand out against the competition, otherwise no one would hear her, she was just another "aspiring" musician. Now, she's a somebody. She has a name. She can be normal if she wants to, but I think she enjoys being OTT, she knows it's working, she makes the headlines with every new outfit she comes up with. Plus, it must be fantastic to be a celebrity and have NO ONE recodnise you out of your "image" :)

I definitely understand where you're coming from and I appreciate the sentiment. I just feel sad when I look at myself and don't see what I would like. I've gotten over any embarrassment with regards to what others think. I'd really like to just be happy with what I have, and most of the time it's not on my mind at all, but if I'm being honest I'd love to fill in shirts and dresses better, not bust out of them, but just fit properly so they aren't hanging off of me. I hate clothes shopping and that's a big part of why, nothing is really designed for flat girls. Not in my income range anyway.
it's ok. small chested girls make me have a sad too.
It's probably because for her, it's about what she likes, not about what you do.
I don't think it's what she likes.  I think it's what she thinks that the world likes.
That's not a good thing. It's like saying, "Your breasts are so small, it's just like you had breast cancer and got them removed!"
Next time my girlfriend complains about her boobs I'll let her know that it's OK, at least she can wear suspenders.
Not that it's really the same thing but that's like telling a fat person "don't worry there's a ton of people who have fat fetishes!"
Obviously having small boobs is commonly more preferred than being fat but it's still not a super conforming sentiment.
Yeah, the way I see it.......okay, it's nice that you and others like small boobs, that people find them attractive. But I don't. And I'm the one who has to live with 'em.
Definitely still need a sports bra - though you're right that it's probably no where near as uncomfortable. They still bounce a little bit.
Not that I play golf but I've heard that it's also easier with small breasts.

It's not really that we have a monopoly on Reddit's advertising system, it's just that there are not a lot of advertisers on Reddit in general. We actually pay the minimum amount required per day to advertise ($30 per subreddit), and are usually competing with a few different ads each day. Redditors love the site, the 5K+ upvotes and comments are all legit (as krispykrackers confirmed above), and this ad brings us a ton of new visitors, so it's worthwhile for us to keep this ad running every day.
It's because it's the same thread being promoted, those are the same comments you see everytime.

Hahaha I think it was a bigger problem when the comics code authority cracked down on them. They had to create villains that weren't overtly threatening. Now it's the opposite, everyone's trying to out-grit and out-brutalize each other.
"Apelsin - Kolsyrad läskedryck" Basically means that it's orange flavored carbonated soda.
Not that anyone would likely crack it open and drink it... but if it's been in storage for roughly as long as it is old without severe agitation, all the syrup and additives have come out of suspension... the top part is all carbonated water, and the lower part is all syrup and coloring.
I cracked a Pepsi from dad's cupboard and realized that the soda was bland-- thought, "oh... it's just caffeine free... and flavor free."  So I poured it in the sink and it came out clear followed by brown sludge.
There is a protective liner along the inside of the can, protecting the metal from the liquid, however it is easily punctured, particularly if the can has ever been dented (either by you or somewhere along the process shipping from the factory to the store). Once that happens, it's not a question of if but when it will begin to leak everywhere and destroy everything you hold dear.

Your park rating will drop, but it's oh so fun.
It was one of those deals where they released almost the exact same game but with a few minor changes and called it '2'. There are new rides and things, it's more or less an expansion park.
The only really notable difference is that you could stack scenery. In the first one you could only build little walls on the grass, but once you are able to stack scenery, you can work upward too, so it allowed you to build little houses and things, with roofs and that. This made little difference to the game, but once the modding community got hold of it, they made their own scenery, and used this new stacking ability to make incredibly complex structures and things. Just take a look at the links I provided, it's amazing, but still so time consuming; each piece on each square is placed by hand.
But you're forgetting it's called Universe Sandbox.
check out GOG...they sometimes have sales too and it's DRM free

That's what reddit's for.
Actually, it's >7 billion now.
Every 150 minutes there is 1 year of video uploaded, that is INCREDIBLE. My mind is blown just trying to comprehend consuming that much content and it's uploaded EVERY 150 minutes!
Reddit isn't useful to me because it's a link aggregator or a forum. It's useful because it's a scalable and universal system for screening content, from videos to products to music or fashion. Google has spent the last few years trying to tackle "social search." Reddit ended up doing by accident.
With inflation it's more like over 9.86 based on this huffpost article.
The problem that drives reposts isn't a lack of content - it's a lack of good content, and good ways to separate the good from the bad. The reason we get reposts is that they've already gotten past the "is this good or bad?" filter, and so can be depended on. If good content is a needle in a stack of shit, then reposts are all those needles that have been painstakingly grabbed from the shit and already set aside.
If you filter out videos of cats and crap lets plays, it's about 30 minutes.
This is strongly in line with the lifestyle of it's founder and CEO, Tristam Shandy.

Ya know sometimes, as a parent, it's just better to let your kid not eat their peas and green beans if they don't want to.
Because parents are supposed to be proud when their children kill or die for their country, not when they speak up when it's illegal or may offend people.
the speaking up I can deal with it's their right as humans to do so, the breaking and entering, destruction of property and assault I cannot.
It's an acceptable form of justice as far as I'm concerned since it's not changing the law it's just bending it so it doesn't create any dangerous precedents (i.e. they would of been charged with what they were charged with regardless but likely wouldn't of gotten anywhere near the max sentence if it wasn't for all this other stuff I'm guessing).
No. Tolokonnikova was one of the founders and leaders, not simply a member. Samutsevich was one of the other members of Voina as you can see from their video and photo reports. As for other two pussy riot members (one of which wasn't caught), it's not clear at all, since neither group has listed their membership for their own safety sake.
Because it's a horrible travesty to the values of the civilized and democratic world, which Russia half-heartedly pretends to be a part of.
I was born in the Soviet Union, and I guess it's clear why the West abandoned us after World War 2.
They're not progressive. They have never fought for anything in their lives. They're a typical US shopper/worker with a cozy priviliged life. In a bubble like that it's difficult to understand.
You're right, but as I said a few times now, it's almost guaranteed that their previous criminal history comes into consideration when a sentence is being handed down hence the 2 years they received.
Fun fact: there's a purposefully funny Russian dub of the Lord of the Rings, and Mordor becomes Mordovia, Gondor becomes Honduras, etc. In Russian it's hilarious.
I'm glad to have more facts, glad to have read the article. But I found it grating that the author emphasized what the facilities used to be used for by a different government. I get the symbolism here. The right way to handle this is to point out the symbolism and then report accurately about the current conditions at these facilities. Propaganda bothers me, even when it's for "my side."
This may be true, but to put bullshit quoted by them in the headline in such a way will make it seem like it's the truth.  Such a line should be in the article, and it should be followed with a debunking, but it shouldn't be the headline, as that will mislead people and the media knows this.
... but it's for their "singing", and not their activism, so it's completely justified.
that raises the question about the legitimacy of the protest, not the power => it's counterproductive

Use sacrificial drone comb - make absolutely sure it's removed while brood still capped
Interesting other issue are bats are coming down with the white nose syndrome (fungus) which is killing them off. They eat insects, and it's entirely possible that not only are we killing insects but in turn we are killing the animals that eat insects, too.
Maybe it's just me but I never really understood why people thought it was a great idea to spray poison all over and why they are surprised when it kills things. I mean, it doesn't take "human poison" to kill me - could be rat poison, could be weed poison, could be bug poison. Likewise with other life forms.
That's not what I meant, I guess I was unclear. What I meant is that it's unsurprising to me that pesticide and herbicide causes massive "collateral damage" to bees, seeing as how pesticide and herbicide at those levels would cause the same damage to most animals.
Sorry, I guess my comment was unclear. What I mean is that since obviously we spend some effort checking crops to make sure that the very small levels of residual pesticide/herbicide do not harm humans, it's utterly unsurprising that much higher levels of pesticide and herbicide harm bees.
Those insects become resistant to that pesticide (or it's found to be too toxic) and they stop it's use, and use something else.  And the cycle repeats.
someone finds a new article, or a new article finds old research.  And every time informed people groan because it's fairly well established as a bunch of causes, and pesticides aren't necessarily even a top one.
This research is important and novel because it's replicating field-level exposures on bumblebee colonies of two pesticides (a neonicitinoid and a pyrethroid) in combination as well as individually, this hasn't been done before.
Heck it's one of the reasons GM foods are so important. Because the current nuke spray effect of pesticides is far more harmful then the controlled levels plants naturally produce, and if we can replicate nature, it'll probably be better for everyone.
I don't think news articles paint the picture right.  There's company involvement all over the place, but most farms, in the states I have lived in, are actually owned and operated by farmers, then they give their crops to a pool/company that distributes.  If a company owns a farm, it's a company started by the family that started the farm.  I have two grandmothers that own a substantial amount of family farms, which act as their retirement income.  The farm is still mostly operated by family members though.
So since Agent Orange is a defoliant it's safe to eat.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11vz4g/amazon_closes_womans_account_and_wipes_her_kindle/
According to this interview with Linn, it appears that she bought her first Kindle used,  so it's not entirely inconceivable that it's related to the account tied to the previous owner of that Kindle.
I should add that in addition to emailing, I did call, several times. While it's hard to say if it helped, it was definitely more helpful than emailing.
I only got back a really surley fuck you type message. So then I inquired again politely and got the same shitty response back. Took the gloves off and, without any actual threats, etc mind you, just a bit of a tyraid on how they could treat their customers this way it's not right, etc etc, some tech emails me back saying I'm being threatening and has called the cops on me.
Amazon is now going to release a statement explaining what happened, and it's going to turn out that this woman's Credit Card information has been used in multiple other accounts and Amazon was basically just shutting down all the accounts so that card can't be used anymore on their site.
THAT SAID, how Amazon's handling this is bullshit and they should absolutely be providing her with enough information to know exactly what's going on.  Plus, of course, it's rather troubling to think that your Kindle and everything you purchased for it could be wiped out entirely at the whim of Amazon, with no recourse besides legal action.
Either way, while I'm not saying it's impossible this is 100% an error on Amazon's part, I'm still guessing there's more to the story on the customer's end than we're hearing.
I had a similar problem with Amazon, I think for them it's par for the course to not provide any details why they close an account. I tried calling them a few times - at one time one of the customer reps said that there was no problem with my account, but with an account from a customer in another city who has the same name as I do. (Fine, I have an relatively unusual name, but not that unusual. And really - the credit card details say where I live, so why is that an issue?)
In my experience it's fairly typical for large companies not to provide details in cases which are related to some kind of account fraud or related abuse. The more details they make available, the more vulnerable their detection tech is to gaming by scammers.
It's pretty baffling all around, so don't think I'm defending Amazon TOO much here.  I'm just saying, it's still safe to assume that companies have a purpose to their actions, at least most of the time.
With that said, this post is disturbing.  Regardless of whether she did or didn't do something wrong, or Amazon simply made a mistake, it's not good that we're headed in a direction where large corporations "own" what you "buy" and have the ability to repossess or destroy it with no explanation, no due process and no viable recourse.
I'm sure I've used terms like "purchased" to describe digital media before. I just wanted to use this opportunity to point out the distinction to people who might not otherwise know about it, because it's very relevant to the discussion at hand.
That's probably the most sensible idea. If she lost enough to be worth her time then she should at least contact the amazon legal department and say if it's not sorted out then she will take legal action.
See, the problem is, when I see Amazon could suspend my account by mistake and deny me access to the stuff I bought from them, not tell me why or otherwise try to help fix the mistake, and my only recourse would be to get a lawyer and perhaps go to court, as a potential customer it just doesn't make me want to do business with them. It's too risky and complicated. And it's their loss more than it is mine.
Digital media with restrictions like this should be treated for what they are: rentals. As such, they are only deserving of a rental's price. This is why I never spend more than $10 for a Steam game, or $1-2 for an eBook. If it's not mine, then it's still the seller's, in which case they don't deserve full price for it.
Interestingly enough, only Apple has thus far actually moved to a model embracing technology's strengths without the inane restrictions, but even there it's only with music (and still limited to lossy formats).
This. Also, it's not Amazon deciding on whether an e-book should have DRM or not, it's the publishers. Amazon's actually been fighting a huge legal battle against the publishers, in behalf of their customers to prevent the fucked-up pricing that's been happening (e-books costing as much, and sometimes more than the hard cover version).
The point here isn't who caused the problem, the point here is that Amazon isn't even trying to help this customer fix it. The worst part, for me, is where they stated that "any subsequent account" would be closed as well. What the actual fuck? This is essentially banning the person altogether. I don't think it's wrong to terminate the account of someone who broke the rules, but to keep terminating any new accounts after they've learned a lesson? That's just mean and hostile. And especially so if you refuse to tell the person why you banned them to begin with.
It's shitty, but well within the terms of service, and it's something people should be aware of before they tie so much of their life/purchases to an account that could be closed on a whim.
The problem is when problems occur which the customer service agent in India isn't capable of solving.  This is when you see the beautiful surface of Amazon peel away and what's left is a rotten core of cold heartless automation, the Hades of customer service.  By definition you will get absolutely no assistance here because it's completely devoid of human thought or compassion; again, Amazon is built to ignore the most time consuming customers.  They don't want you, and thus your complaints will be met with mindless form emails until you give up and leave.  Amazon: 1, Annoying Customer: 0.
Believe it or not, I still shop at Amazon because their shopping system is far and away the best.  And if something goes wrong I'm sure I can usually get a decent remedy.  But I have no illusions about the way the company works behind the scenes.  I hope nobody here personally has to deal with Amazon on the same level I did, because it's hell.
No, but it's how many businesses behave as soon as there is the slightest whiff of something that interests the "security" department.
It's usually an issue of some dipshit who loves the power they have to close accounts and goes overboard in assuming somethings bad or fishy when it's not. Once these folks close accounts, it usually took someone higher up like me to MAKE them understand they did a bad thing and open the account back up. Even then, they would smirk and say they weren't wrong. It was absurd.
E: Looks like the Internet killed the blog site. Basically it's someone saying Amazon killed his friend's account and remotely wiped her Kindle because the account was 'related to an existing closed account', and in the following email chain tells her any future accounts will also be closed and refuses to tell her any further details and ends with "we're not going to discuss the matter further" and "thank you for understanding our decision"
Yeah, I mean it's not like they are playing fair. It's a capitalist system, it pays off to be an opportunist, they take advantages of the system and it's fine. But when your avarage Joe does it, it is wrong?
I also don't like this weird digital-age notion content producers have that they can take back what they sold you. If a copy of a file on your computer is considered an "item" (as they insist it is when pirates "publish" millions of copies), and you've bought it, then it's theft for them to take it back. Imagine if publishers (or recording studios, or movie studios) were allowed to walk into your home and box up your books, movies, and DVDs. I would call the goddamn cops on them, and they would go to jail, because that's theft.
She probably violated some form of terms or contract a person does when registering their product. Rarely happens, except they took action. They may not be informing her of her breach do to reason of pursuing other activity related to her account. Although not fair it's my game plan if I was Amazon. Possible she was taking copywritten material and posting that data elsewhere. Uploading to torrents. Honestly a little extreme.

What wouldn't surprise me is hearing something equivalent from Obama. After 3 thankless years of trying to turn around problems he didn't create, while taking all the blame for it, he's still out there campaigning and trying to do the job again. Fucking amazing that he isn't up there going "Hey Romney it's all yours. Good luck, buddy. I'm going to go sit on a beach and watch the world burn."
He's saying the salesman needs to make more money for his family for when he dies. I mean it's either cars or blue meth.
That's because it's been conveniently left out of the media narrative.
Mitt Romney was born in 1947, meaning he would have been 19 in 1966. Age 19 is exactly in the age range where every male member of the LDS church goes on a mission. It's not "convenient", it's just how LDS missions work.
Former Mormon here, not every 19 year old boy goes on a mission, it's a choice. So he clearly chose to do that while avoiding the draft. There were plenty of men that chose the opposite even though they were Mormon 19 year olds.
The problem isn't just in the federal government as an organism, it's in individual government officials that have no integrity.
Unfortunately, there are enough people out there who take religion seriously enough that it's not very pragmatic to mock them in public.  It's not like you have to fall back on his religion to make Romney look ridiculous, anyway.
I think it's more that the title it's without context rather than being misleading. The title just quotes Romney.  I didn't interpret that to mean he running to make money at all (he's a billionaire for chrissake -- who becomes president for the $$?)
They can't fathom that, there are many people who have conservative parents or upbringing, and yet became liberals because /r/politics is not distorting information, it's linking to well-researched news articles by journalists. In the age of the internet, we can check and verify, the truthfulness of /r/politics, and yet these people are flat out saying "LIBERAL MEDIA"; one person in /r/askreddit, got downvoted for saying 'liberal media myth', and people accused him of liberal bias. Anything that doesn't fit their conservative worldview == liberal bias and thus false!
We're calling them "Low information voters" until the middle of November when it's okay to offend them again.
What I can't figure out -- and I've spoken to a number of teachers about it, and no one knows -- is who actually believes this bullshit.  Someone, somewhere, is making policy that no one can fail, that the tests are unfair, that if the material were just taught differently than every child would be smart.  But I don't know who these people are, or why they believe this way.  Hell, I can't even figure out who decided they should stop keeping score in softball; everyone acknowledges that it's bullshit, but that's just the way it's played now.
To be fair, what about all the black voters that came out in 2008 that never voted a day in their life? I do understand that it's a bit different coming from a minority group. On the other hand, I don't feel like the same voters would come out if it was someone like Herman Cain.
the polls are incredibly inaccurate. take this poll for instance, it's the only poll putting Romney ahead.
It's the same brain washing that keeps kids in at night and teaches them to brush their teeth, so let's not take that thought process TOO far.  It comes down to humans being limited in their abilities.  The spectrum is so wide, so vast that anyone wanting to cast a wide political net must first chose to generalized a possibly misleading message, and every political message needs a boogey-man.  When you look at the messages closely it's clear - Democrats blame the republicans, themselves and the past.  The republicans blame anyone but themselves at all costs, and they almost always blame the opponent as a part of their opening line, and then go on to vaguely offer a solution, to be explained and executed AFTER the republican is placed in office.  I'm not saying the democrats are being honest or informed in their description of the placed blame, but I am saying that when a kid comes up to you and blames everyone in the world but himself for the broken lamp, it's pretty clear what happened. Now in this scenario with a broken lamp, a kid with an excuse, and mom the results are clear, but what if this house is full of a LOT of other kids and some adults, but everyone gets equal votes?  That kid with the explanation of what went wrong simply has to speak more loudly and keep his story on track to convince enough OTHER kids that his story is true.  That is the simple method in which the republicans ensure the race will always be close these days, vague up the message to everyone, relying on how busy and uninformed people HAVE to be thanks to the limitations of humans in a drowning economy, and always blame the other guy no matter what.  The only thing that can bring down this type of play is an informed public, and so far we ain't gettin' that.
romnesia at it's finest

But it's totally true.  The money is in Washington.  And every President, Senator and Congressmen participates in the corruption.  Even your grand leader ___ (enter name here) is corrupt.  You want real change you need to understand that almost everything you learn in school is a lie to brainwash you into a system of slavery.  Once you know that to be true you can start re-learning the truths of the world and help wake up others.  The only way to change and be free is to educate everyone in what it means to be free.  Religion and Government are here to control you.  These elections mean nothing.  Whoever you vote for will not change things for the better for you, but only change things for the government by consolidation.  The govenment will get bigger and control more and more and make more laws.  And you will still be a worker.  The education system is here to indoctrinate you into thinking you can't survive without being someone's employee - IE: someones slave.  It's never about you being free to live without needing to be an employee.  You don't get taught to own your own land, farm and grow food for yourself.  It's always about you working for someone else, getting paid money to go to the store to buy their crap that you could have grown yourself.   Learn what Serfdom means.  Obama is for big corporations, war, wallstreet, and bailouts for bankers.  Romney is the same.  Make no mistake they are the same.  They want war and money and they don't give a damn about you.  They never did.  Grow up.
Gosh, it's almost like he's a Machiavellian, lying sack of shit.

Why are there still monkeys - We didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and monkeys have a common ancestor. Asking why are there still monkeys is like asking if you came from your cousin, why are your cousins still here -- it's nonsensical.
What humans have a problem in accepting, is the concept that the universe contains the physics that create time and space; it's impossible for us to really grasp the concept of something from nothing, or nothingness itself because we've never experienced nothing, or anything that has no external form.  *if you die and are nothing, the brain cannot reconcile that notion to anything its ever experienced; how can something like our conscious mind become nothing?  It's far easier to think that we are transformed into something else which allows our conscious mind to carry on to eternity (whatever that actually means).
{...}Grand Canyon form? the force of Colorado river. Ever been there? you should, it's an amazing place.
Isn't it awful how that christian who wrote the thing equates homosexuality and pornography to murder and rape? Those are so unrelated it's not even funny, but obviously to a christian homosexuality or self pleasure is so reprehensible it's up there with violence. I would never equate violence (such as rape and murder) to love (be it hetero, homo, or solo)
I think you have it; it's pretty weak.  Look through the blog.  Seems to be Christian baiting.
Why does my cock fit into my hand so nicely if it's a sin to masturbate?

For what it's worth, I'm a Christian, and I'll give my two cents if anyone would be interested.  (if not, downvote oblivion here i come!)
If we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?  Um.  Well, I don't believe we did come from monkeys, so this is a moot question.  But assuming that I did not believe, according to my understanding of evolution, it's not so much that people came from monkeys, but rather that they shared a similar ancestor.
Yes I have.  I don't know if it's real or not, but to me and what I believe in, it changes nothing.

Someone incredibly familiar with the IEM here. It has nothing to do with corn futures. The reason it isn't regulated is because traders can only invest $500. Anything more than that and the CFTC would consider them a gambling house. Honestly, it is 100% betting on the election, but it's used for research and they don't make a profit, so the CFTC says it's cool.
On top of that, Nate Silver would seem to justify Reddit's bias.
I'm currently reading Nate Silver's book, and it's fascinating to see all of the different factors that must be aggregated to make these predictions.  Very interesting stuff.
The media likes to emphasize the popular vote because it's a lot closer than the electoral vote. If people think Obama has it all sewn up they might stop watching the circus.
This personalization has a really negative effect on how we are informed as citizens. Just by browsing Reddit, you'll passively reinforce particular existing views - and even radicalize them. Without any content to counter or challenge the things we want to see, Reddit essentially becomes an echo chamber. We hear what we already think because the website is personalized to us, and because we hear it again, we think it's right. This effect is vastly compounded if Reddit is your only source of news. Because there is no overarching content control, there is no pressure to supply the other side(s) to issues.
Every time I've posted something that's portrays Obama, Liz Warren, etc in a negative light (which always comes from a good source) it's not only not upvoted, it's actively downvoted by numerous people.
I would love a more neutral subreddit with stricter rules on fact checking and serious comments (no puns, lame jokes and other meaningless posts), because it's almost as bad as /r/athesim in there.
There is also an age component at play here.  Reddit's demographic skews toward liberalism.  It also skews heavily toward those who are just out of college or just starting out in careers, aren't making any money yet and feel powerless.  Those folks, by and large, aren't voting for Romney.
There was an article that went out last week that researched Romney's remark during the debate about the President's pension. Politifact looked into it and found out Obama's pension is set up through the Cayman islands with investments in China. It's also much larger than Romney's. This isn't necessarily the Presidents fault as it's a blind investment setup through Illinois but highly hypocritical of his administration to criticize Romney for the same thing.
I was hoping it would garner some actual discussion (and vitriol) but apparently the post just got largely ignored. I suspect it  would have been on the top of /r/politics for weeks if it was Romney. Honestly I think /r/politics should have it's name changed.
Except the point about American politics being shifted right still stands when you look globally comparing America to other Western nations. The point about a shift to the left does not exist when you look outside the US. Seems like one side has a bit more support for it's case.
Except it's not a point of view, it's a fact. In the "left" / "right" political spectrum the true far left would be your socialism/communism (and don't forget anarcho-syndicalist-communes, lol). In meaningful use of the political spectrum there's no confusion.
I think it's the vote system that fucks everything up. It's meant to be used to vote discussions to the top, but it's used to vote dissenting opinions out of existence. Downvoting things you don't personally agree with is not what the system is in place for, but that's sure as hell how it's used.
Rather, it's just "Their conditions are different.  Case closed.  The end.".
I've noticed the whole Romney-is-evil thing here as well, but what's more troubling to me about political discourse on Reddit is how conservatives as a whole are treated. Reading comments on r/politics, you'd think that there's absolutely no logical basis for a conservative ideology. Sure, I disagree with most of what the GOP currently stands for, but it's possible to agree with the party and be an intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate person. Reading Reddit, you don't get a sense of any of that.
Maybe, but since the start of the month Obama has the lead in 4 polls compared to Romney's 8. Most of these leads on both sides are within the margin of error, but still I'd say it's more likely to go for Romney.
However, polls always have a margin of error, and even that margin of error is not an absolute indicator due to the confidence margin or whatever the statistical term is. I.e. a poll can have a 4 point margin of error but a 1 in 20 chance of being off the mark anyways, I think it's called a p-value, I never actually had a class on it all.
Well, seeing as a ton of the posts from r/politics are just retarded blogs, and at least 50% of the posts are filled with top comments saying "this article is complete bullshit" with intelligent discussion as to why, and then the second or third top comment is "People need to see this and wake up! This country is being destroyed. We aren't free! Romney will destroy us all!" I think it's safe to say that we are incredibly distorted. Not that others aren't, but if you believe Reddit isn't a source with a huge democratic bias, you probably don't value facts that much when it comes to making up your mind about something.  The truth and lies that a news article is composed of is like a smoothie of propaganda, which is which is only distinguishable if you put in the time to check sources, reliability, and how much facts are stretched.
On the other hand it's very comfy to be around people whom you agree with, and it creates a nice, self-perpetuating bubble of smug arrogance (as in my post). It does not mean it's not true, but it can make yourself feel more important than you really are.
I also think there's an element of arrogance involved as well. In the sense that it's unacceptable to admit something as important as an American Election could be so one-sided and predictable. American pop culture is all about drama, drama, drama; and there's no drama in a predictable outcome.

Hi Mr Roberts! First I want to thank you for doing this AMA and also for being so brave and challenging the industry and it's BS console focused mindset. This project is one that I personally had given up on ever seeing and I believe it will have a massive impact on the future of gaming. I am very excited.
And an advice about translating the game in other languages if I may: Please keep the names of the cities, planets and other stuff in the original language. WoW made that mistake and it's really annoying and confusing with all the different names of the cities for example.
Will we be able to build as well as purchase? I don't mean in the RTS sense, but will we be able to establish our own base of operations, in the sense that it's not a ship, but a stationary base?
Also, IIRC, it's been stated that in engagements, 'slots' will be reserved for your friends to jump in and help. Does this mean it won't be a 'come and go as you please' universe or am I just mistaken, which I probably am. Already gonna buy, but this clarification would just get me all the more titalated. Thanks!
Or are you aiming at some other point in the spectrum?  I watched the S42 trailer many, many times, and the speeds and distances involved look similar to WCP, but I know it's very early stage and still a prototype tech demo.  Just wanted to know if the trailer is representative of the combat pacing you're aiming for.
First off, thank you for doing this AMA and the work you’ve done in the past. My questions focus primarily on some of the less space sim-y aspects of Star Citizen. I apologize if these questions have already been asked, it's hard to keep track of all the information. If you could answer just one or two I’d appreciate it.
This game seems ambitious on a scale we haven't seen before.  MMO/single/super detail/super fast/open ended it seems like it's tackling every angle at once.
-I feel like doing the 5$ = __ credits right away is removing the "I've earned this item because of my skills/time spent ingame". Do you think it's ahred amongst player, and if so, how are you going to solve that?
I was wondering if you were planning to implement TrackIR support. You're a PC man and I'm assuming you've heard of the device. I know it's not mega-popular, but it enahances the immersion in games in a way I can't even describe.
Also, how in-depth will customization go in the game? Will it only be "skin deep" with colors and such? I understand that the ships have a large number of modeled parts for realistic damage, but could we be provided with a modular custom ship creator? Say I save up a massive amount of money, could I build a custom Cruiser with a small landing bay in back for one or two fighters? Maybe there would be a buch of prefabricated rooms, engines, features and armament that I could arrange how I wanted and then give it it's armored skin over top to finish construction. Is this idea possible? Not possible? Why?
The original Wing Commander and it's sequels were hugely influential on my life.  I credit my career in IT directly with the skills and lessons I learned while learning how to make these games run properly on various computers over the years.
I just want to say, you are amazing!!! I am still playing freelancer (discovery mod) since its really the only space sim that gets it right. It has held up amazingly well for being such an old game, and I'm so excited for the improvements you're bringing to Star Citizen. As an engineer, the fly by wire system has me really excited! I absolutely cannot wait to play this game, and I'm even considering buying a dedicated gaming rig just to play it in all it's glory!

You forgot to put words over it. Reddit won't upvote comments like this unless it's a gif or reiterates the message on the picture.
"This guy is right, for once it's not a video or story about a girl being shot or raped, good on us, for once."
As it seems like none of my previous classmates are redditors I feel it's my duty to defend my school against some of the less constructive comments.
This is Witney M. Young high school and it's a magnet school in Chicago. Top 3 in the city, 4th in the state, and around 135 in the nation. It's pretty funny reading a bunch of comments about this "inner city" school, when in fact the majority of the students in that video are probably enrolled in AP classes and will receive offers of enrollment from some of the top universities in the country.
To be fair, it's not really reddit logic. It's the American middle-class suburb logic.
Haha thank you. Although I do provide some evidence in some of my replies to back up the claim that this school is supposed to be good. But I don't see how it's not believable that a video of kids being kids (not really kids) can come from a school with high test scores. No matter where you are, at the ages of 14–18 you're going to do ridiculous things and be rowdy. In fact, you probably know that in these schools no one really causes trouble, so that's why the teachers don't shut it down right away because they know it probably won't get too out of control despite how loud it is. I'm guessing within a minute after the video stopped, some high up faculty walks by, tells them to quiet down, and everyone goes back to being normal.
Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
What makes you think it's from the inner city?
If you serve someone back after getting served, then it's on.
Wait... so high school today really IS like it's portrayed in those stupid dance movies?
Just wait until you see their football games. It's not about football at all, it's just an opportunity for each school's marching band to compete with each other.
Oh it's on.
Oh...it's on!
but now it's on....

This is an MRI scan, so it's a cross sectional image.
Exactly. There's no doubt that one is bigger than the other but as far as comparisons go, you can't go in too much details since it's not the same cut.
Correct me if I'm wrong [edit: I am wrong, see /u/Mansy's comment below], but I don't think this isn't an MRI scan. I think it's images taken in a method akin to the Visible Human Project - literally images of frozen cadavers which are photographed cross-sectionally, then a layer is removed (destructively), a new photo taken and so on and so forth.
it's hard to see the plane in which these are taken, but I think those are eyes.
Being fat is unhealthy, same as smoking. We should ultimately respect people's decisions, but I don't see how it's unreasonable to suggest that overweight people lose some weight.
So it's farts.
Jesus the human heart is huge, it's weirding me out man
yeah, I once saw a scan of my chest and all I though was "damn, what the hell is this thing? it's freakin huge!" ... "oh, that's the heart?? :o"
it's all good, You left it on, but you also left the side door open, so I walked in and turned it off.
No, it's more than just that. Look at the muscle development on the interior side of the ankles, and the shape of the ankles themselves. Her disorders are related to more than just being overweight, although i'm sure it's adding additional strain and not improving her situation.
I know jack about MRIs but I'm guessing it's only because of how the MRI take's a 'slice'. It's probably the same reason why the arm bones aren't visible on each women, since they would be angled downwards while laying on a table
It is not healthy that fat people have larger hearts. It's the body's way of adapting to needing to supply more blood. When the heart does this, it is prone to heart-attacks and cardiovascular diseases. Being obese puts tremendous strain on the heart, so no, it's not healthy.
See, it's not bullying.
Yes, it's visceral fat (fat that surrounds the organs). It's very unhealthy to have a significant amount of visceral fat because your body faces a huge risk in heart problems, diabetes and various other health issues.
If it's a CT scan, dark areas are less dense.  You can usually tell if a person has gas by a black area in the stomach.  (disclaimer: I am not a radiologist).  If dark area was shit, then this person inhaled a ton of it into her lungs.
If it's a CT scan ... I suck at reading MRI's though.
No, it's just air. Unfortunately, you won't be able to say "Fat girls are full of shit, I've seen it!"
yeah, i have the same problem getting through doorways as well. not because i'm so large (since i'm 1% bodyfat) but because my dick is 36 inches long and always erect. it's very hard traversing through tight knit indoor environments and sharp turns when you have that much sway and inertia in your lower body.

Gaga has a pretty great voice, it's just not as unique as Adele's-
I think the music biz really is like this. Some guy thought that the "lady gaga" marketing campaign is what was needed. Was it? Would more people have liked her original image? No one can truly say. I think that the perception of the gatekeeper has much more to do with what is inflicted upon us than the reality of what people really like. I mean, it's not as if Adele needed to be marketed as Princess Delly or something with backup dancers in tow.
Yeah, except the whole child prodigy thing. I'm not a fan of her or her music but she apparently has some serious chops. Also pop music is meant to be superficial and vapid. Consequently it's also designed to make a lot of money as well. During every part of modern music there are people that hear whatever is popular and decry how it's leading to the decay of society. It's just not true. Jazz and Rock n' Roll were supposed to lead to the doom of the world, but that never happened. Basically you just shouldn't make sweeping generalizations like that based on the like 2 songs you heard from her.
As a competent guitar player, I'm at the point where I don't like certain players because of the knowledge that being a musician imparts to me. For me one of these players is Slash. As a rock band, G'n'R is pretty great, but I can't just listen to them without analyzing Slash's playing. It sounds good, but it's not great in the guitar realm. When my relatives found out I was a guitar player they all seemed to jump on the "play me Sweet Child" bandwagon but when I explained that I didn't know it because I didn't like Slash, their response was akin to "shut up, he's famous and you're not, so he's done something right."
Meanwhile I was studying SRV, BB King, Townshend, and Hendrix who are arguably more important to rock than Slash. Can you see the disconnect here? It's not even a matter of talent unless the "victim" (for lack of a better word) is going around saying how much better they are than x or y; it's usually a matter of taste.
Let's be honest...lyrically and musically speaking it's all been done before and pretty much half the insane bullshit she does was done by Madonna before her.
oh hey look it's a normal hot person
Oh ok so because you like Bowies music more, so it's ok for him to act weird
the reason she became famous was because of her standing out. She HAD to stand out against the competition, otherwise no one would hear her, she was just another "aspiring" musician. Now, she's a somebody. She has a name. She can be normal if she wants to, but I think she enjoys being OTT, she knows it's working, she makes the headlines with every new outfit she comes up with. Plus, it must be fantastic to be a celebrity and have NO ONE recodnise you out of your "image" :)

...With Reddit's ability to hit on anyone as soon as they find out someone's a woman?
I definitely understand where you're coming from and I appreciate the sentiment. I just feel sad when I look at myself and don't see what I would like. I've gotten over any embarrassment with regards to what others think. I'd really like to just be happy with what I have, and most of the time it's not on my mind at all, but if I'm being honest I'd love to fill in shirts and dresses better, not bust out of them, but just fit properly so they aren't hanging off of me. I hate clothes shopping and that's a big part of why, nothing is really designed for flat girls. Not in my income range anyway.
it's ok. small chested girls make me have a sad too.
It's probably because for her, it's about what she likes, not about what you do.
I don't think it's what she likes.  I think it's what she thinks that the world likes.
That's not a good thing. It's like saying, "Your breasts are so small, it's just like you had breast cancer and got them removed!"
Next time my girlfriend complains about her boobs I'll let her know that it's OK, at least she can wear suspenders.
Not that it's really the same thing but that's like telling a fat person "don't worry there's a ton of people who have fat fetishes!"
Obviously having small boobs is commonly more preferred than being fat but it's still not a super conforming sentiment.
Yeah, the way I see it.......okay, it's nice that you and others like small boobs, that people find them attractive. But I don't. And I'm the one who has to live with 'em.
Definitely still need a sports bra - though you're right that it's probably no where near as uncomfortable. They still bounce a little bit.
Not that I play golf but I've heard that it's also easier with small breasts.

It seems like it's always 8/10
It's not really that we have a monopoly on Reddit's advertising system, it's just that there are not a lot of advertisers on Reddit in general. We actually pay the minimum amount required per day to advertise ($30 per subreddit), and are usually competing with a few different ads each day. Redditors love the site, the 5K+ upvotes and comments are all legit (as krispykrackers confirmed above), and this ad brings us a ton of new visitors, so it's worthwhile for us to keep this ad running every day.
It's because it's the same thread being promoted, those are the same comments you see everytime.

Hahaha I think it was a bigger problem when the comics code authority cracked down on them. They had to create villains that weren't overtly threatening. Now it's the opposite, everyone's trying to out-grit and out-brutalize each other.
"Apelsin - Kolsyrad läskedryck" Basically means that it's orange flavored carbonated soda.
Not that anyone would likely crack it open and drink it... but if it's been in storage for roughly as long as it is old without severe agitation, all the syrup and additives have come out of suspension... the top part is all carbonated water, and the lower part is all syrup and coloring.
I cracked a Pepsi from dad's cupboard and realized that the soda was bland-- thought, "oh... it's just caffeine free... and flavor free."  So I poured it in the sink and it came out clear followed by brown sludge.
There is a protective liner along the inside of the can, protecting the metal from the liquid, however it is easily punctured, particularly if the can has ever been dented (either by you or somewhere along the process shipping from the factory to the store). Once that happens, it's not a question of if but when it will begin to leak everywhere and destroy everything you hold dear.

Your park rating will drop, but it's oh so fun.
It was one of those deals where they released almost the exact same game but with a few minor changes and called it '2'. There are new rides and things, it's more or less an expansion park.
The only really notable difference is that you could stack scenery. In the first one you could only build little walls on the grass, but once you are able to stack scenery, you can work upward too, so it allowed you to build little houses and things, with roofs and that. This made little difference to the game, but once the modding community got hold of it, they made their own scenery, and used this new stacking ability to make incredibly complex structures and things. Just take a look at the links I provided, it's amazing, but still so time consuming; each piece on each square is placed by hand.
But you're forgetting it's called Universe Sandbox.

That's what reddit's for.
Actually, it's >7 billion now.
Every 150 minutes there is 1 year of video uploaded, that is INCREDIBLE. My mind is blown just trying to comprehend consuming that much content and it's uploaded EVERY 150 minutes!
Reddit isn't useful to me because it's a link aggregator or a forum. It's useful because it's a scalable and universal system for screening content, from videos to products to music or fashion. Google has spent the last few years trying to tackle "social search." Reddit ended up doing by accident.
With inflation it's more like over 9.86 based on this huffpost article.
The problem that drives reposts isn't a lack of content - it's a lack of good content, and good ways to separate the good from the bad. The reason we get reposts is that they've already gotten past the "is this good or bad?" filter, and so can be depended on. If good content is a needle in a stack of shit, then reposts are all those needles that have been painstakingly grabbed from the shit and already set aside.
If you filter out videos of cats and crap lets plays, it's about 30 minutes.
This is strongly in line with the lifestyle of it's founder and CEO, Tristam Shandy.

Ya know sometimes, as a parent, it's just better to let your kid not eat their peas and green beans if they don't want to.
Because parents are supposed to be proud when their children kill or die for their country, not when they speak up when it's illegal or may offend people.
the speaking up I can deal with it's their right as humans to do so, the breaking and entering, destruction of property and assault I cannot.
It's an acceptable form of justice as far as I'm concerned since it's not changing the law it's just bending it so it doesn't create any dangerous precedents (i.e. they would of been charged with what they were charged with regardless but likely wouldn't of gotten anywhere near the max sentence if it wasn't for all this other stuff I'm guessing).
No. Tolokonnikova was one of the founders and leaders, not simply a member. Samutsevich was one of the other members of Voina as you can see from their video and photo reports. As for other two pussy riot members (one of which wasn't caught), it's not clear at all, since neither group has listed their membership for their own safety sake.
Because it's a horrible travesty to the values of the civilized and democratic world, which Russia half-heartedly pretends to be a part of.
I was born in the Soviet Union, and I guess it's clear why the West abandoned us after World War 2.
They're not progressive. They have never fought for anything in their lives. They're a typical US shopper/worker with a cozy priviliged life. In a bubble like that it's difficult to understand.
You're right, but as I said a few times now, it's almost guaranteed that their previous criminal history comes into consideration when a sentence is being handed down hence the 2 years they received.
Fun fact: there's a purposefully funny Russian dub of the Lord of the Rings, and Mordor becomes Mordovia, Gondor becomes Honduras, etc. In Russian it's hilarious.
I'm glad to have more facts, glad to have read the article. But I found it grating that the author emphasized what the facilities used to be used for by a different government. I get the symbolism here. The right way to handle this is to point out the symbolism and then report accurately about the current conditions at these facilities. Propaganda bothers me, even when it's for "my side."
This may be true, but to put bullshit quoted by them in the headline in such a way will make it seem like it's the truth.  Such a line should be in the article, and it should be followed with a debunking, but it shouldn't be the headline, as that will mislead people and the media knows this.
... but it's for their "singing", and not their activism, so it's completely justified.
that raises the question about the legitimacy of the protest, not the power => it's counterproductive

Use sacrificial drone comb - make absolutely sure it's removed while brood still capped
Interesting other issue are bats are coming down with the white nose syndrome (fungus) which is killing them off. They eat insects, and it's entirely possible that not only are we killing insects but in turn we are killing the animals that eat insects, too.
Maybe it's just me but I never really understood why people thought it was a great idea to spray poison all over and why they are surprised when it kills things. I mean, it doesn't take "human poison" to kill me - could be rat poison, could be weed poison, could be bug poison. Likewise with other life forms.
That's not what I meant, I guess I was unclear. What I meant is that it's unsurprising to me that pesticide and herbicide causes massive "collateral damage" to bees, seeing as how pesticide and herbicide at those levels would cause the same damage to most animals.
Sorry, I guess my comment was unclear. What I mean is that since obviously we spend some effort checking crops to make sure that the very small levels of residual pesticide/herbicide do not harm humans, it's utterly unsurprising that much higher levels of pesticide and herbicide harm bees.
Those insects become resistant to that pesticide (or it's found to be too toxic) and they stop it's use, and use something else.  And the cycle repeats.
someone finds a new article, or a new article finds old research.  And every time informed people groan because it's fairly well established as a bunch of causes, and pesticides aren't necessarily even a top one.
This research is important and novel because it's replicating field-level exposures on bumblebee colonies of two pesticides (a neonicitinoid and a pyrethroid) in combination as well as individually, this hasn't been done before.
Heck it's one of the reasons GM foods are so important. Because the current nuke spray effect of pesticides is far more harmful then the controlled levels plants naturally produce, and if we can replicate nature, it'll probably be better for everyone.
I don't think news articles paint the picture right.  There's company involvement all over the place, but most farms, in the states I have lived in, are actually owned and operated by farmers, then they give their crops to a pool/company that distributes.  If a company owns a farm, it's a company started by the family that started the farm.  I have two grandmothers that own a substantial amount of family farms, which act as their retirement income.  The farm is still mostly operated by family members though.
So since Agent Orange is a defoliant it's safe to eat.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11vz4g/amazon_closes_womans_account_and_wipes_her_kindle/
According to this interview with Linn, it appears that she bought her first Kindle used,  so it's not entirely inconceivable that it's related to the account tied to the previous owner of that Kindle.
I should add that in addition to emailing, I did call, several times. While it's hard to say if it helped, it was definitely more helpful than emailing.
I only got back a really surley fuck you type message. So then I inquired again politely and got the same shitty response back. Took the gloves off and, without any actual threats, etc mind you, just a bit of a tyraid on how they could treat their customers this way it's not right, etc etc, some tech emails me back saying I'm being threatening and has called the cops on me.
Amazon is now going to release a statement explaining what happened, and it's going to turn out that this woman's Credit Card information has been used in multiple other accounts and Amazon was basically just shutting down all the accounts so that card can't be used anymore on their site.
THAT SAID, how Amazon's handling this is bullshit and they should absolutely be providing her with enough information to know exactly what's going on.  Plus, of course, it's rather troubling to think that your Kindle and everything you purchased for it could be wiped out entirely at the whim of Amazon, with no recourse besides legal action.
Either way, while I'm not saying it's impossible this is 100% an error on Amazon's part, I'm still guessing there's more to the story on the customer's end than we're hearing.
I had a similar problem with Amazon, I think for them it's par for the course to not provide any details why they close an account. I tried calling them a few times - at one time one of the customer reps said that there was no problem with my account, but with an account from a customer in another city who has the same name as I do. (Fine, I have an relatively unusual name, but not that unusual. And really - the credit card details say where I live, so why is that an issue?)
In my experience it's fairly typical for large companies not to provide details in cases which are related to some kind of account fraud or related abuse. The more details they make available, the more vulnerable their detection tech is to gaming by scammers.
It's pretty baffling all around, so don't think I'm defending Amazon TOO much here.  I'm just saying, it's still safe to assume that companies have a purpose to their actions, at least most of the time.
With that said, this post is disturbing.  Regardless of whether she did or didn't do something wrong, or Amazon simply made a mistake, it's not good that we're headed in a direction where large corporations "own" what you "buy" and have the ability to repossess or destroy it with no explanation, no due process and no viable recourse.
I'm sure I've used terms like "purchased" to describe digital media before. I just wanted to use this opportunity to point out the distinction to people who might not otherwise know about it, because it's very relevant to the discussion at hand.
That's probably the most sensible idea. If she lost enough to be worth her time then she should at least contact the amazon legal department and say if it's not sorted out then she will take legal action.
See, the problem is, when I see Amazon could suspend my account by mistake and deny me access to the stuff I bought from them, not tell me why or otherwise try to help fix the mistake, and my only recourse would be to get a lawyer and perhaps go to court, as a potential customer it just doesn't make me want to do business with them. It's too risky and complicated. And it's their loss more than it is mine.
Digital media with restrictions like this should be treated for what they are: rentals. As such, they are only deserving of a rental's price. This is why I never spend more than $10 for a Steam game, or $1-2 for an eBook. If it's not mine, then it's still the seller's, in which case they don't deserve full price for it.
Interestingly enough, only Apple has thus far actually moved to a model embracing technology's strengths without the inane restrictions, but even there it's only with music (and still limited to lossy formats).
This. Also, it's not Amazon deciding on whether an e-book should have DRM or not, it's the publishers. Amazon's actually been fighting a huge legal battle against the publishers, in behalf of their customers to prevent the fucked-up pricing that's been happening (e-books costing as much, and sometimes more than the hard cover version).
The point here isn't who caused the problem, the point here is that Amazon isn't even trying to help this customer fix it. The worst part, for me, is where they stated that "any subsequent account" would be closed as well. What the actual fuck? This is essentially banning the person altogether. I don't think it's wrong to terminate the account of someone who broke the rules, but to keep terminating any new accounts after they've learned a lesson? That's just mean and hostile. And especially so if you refuse to tell the person why you banned them to begin with.
It's shitty, but well within the terms of service, and it's something people should be aware of before they tie so much of their life/purchases to an account that could be closed on a whim.
The problem is when problems occur which the customer service agent in India isn't capable of solving.  This is when you see the beautiful surface of Amazon peel away and what's left is a rotten core of cold heartless automation, the Hades of customer service.  By definition you will get absolutely no assistance here because it's completely devoid of human thought or compassion; again, Amazon is built to ignore the most time consuming customers.  They don't want you, and thus your complaints will be met with mindless form emails until you give up and leave.  Amazon: 1, Annoying Customer: 0.
Believe it or not, I still shop at Amazon because their shopping system is far and away the best.  And if something goes wrong I'm sure I can usually get a decent remedy.  But I have no illusions about the way the company works behind the scenes.  I hope nobody here personally has to deal with Amazon on the same level I did, because it's hell.
No, but it's how many businesses behave as soon as there is the slightest whiff of something that interests the "security" department.
It's usually an issue of some dipshit who loves the power they have to close accounts and goes overboard in assuming somethings bad or fishy when it's not. Once these folks close accounts, it usually took someone higher up like me to MAKE them understand they did a bad thing and open the account back up. Even then, they would smirk and say they weren't wrong. It was absurd.
E: Looks like the Internet killed the blog site. Basically it's someone saying Amazon killed his friend's account and remotely wiped her Kindle because the account was 'related to an existing closed account', and in the following email chain tells her any future accounts will also be closed and refuses to tell her any further details and ends with "we're not going to discuss the matter further" and "thank you for understanding our decision"
Yeah, I mean it's not like they are playing fair. It's a capitalist system, it pays off to be an opportunist, they take advantages of the system and it's fine. But when your avarage Joe does it, it is wrong?
I also don't like this weird digital-age notion content producers have that they can take back what they sold you. If a copy of a file on your computer is considered an "item" (as they insist it is when pirates "publish" millions of copies), and you've bought it, then it's theft for them to take it back. Imagine if publishers (or recording studios, or movie studios) were allowed to walk into your home and box up your books, movies, and DVDs. I would call the goddamn cops on them, and they would go to jail, because that's theft.
She probably violated some form of terms or contract a person does when registering their product. Rarely happens, except they took action. They may not be informing her of her breach do to reason of pursuing other activity related to her account. Although not fair it's my game plan if I was Amazon. Possible she was taking copywritten material and posting that data elsewhere. Uploading to torrents. Honestly a little extreme.

What wouldn't surprise me is hearing something equivalent from Obama. After 3 thankless years of trying to turn around problems he didn't create, while taking all the blame for it, he's still out there campaigning and trying to do the job again. Fucking amazing that he isn't up there going "Hey Romney it's all yours. Good luck, buddy. I'm going to go sit on a beach and watch the world burn."
He's saying the salesman needs to make more money for his family for when he dies. I mean it's either cars or blue meth.
That's because it's been conveniently left out of the media narrative.
Mitt Romney was born in 1947, meaning he would have been 19 in 1966. Age 19 is exactly in the age range where every male member of the LDS church goes on a mission. It's not "convenient", it's just how LDS missions work.
Former Mormon here, not every 19 year old boy goes on a mission, it's a choice. So he clearly chose to do that while avoiding the draft. There were plenty of men that chose the opposite even though they were Mormon 19 year olds.
The problem isn't just in the federal government as an organism, it's in individual government officials that have no integrity.
Unfortunately, there are enough people out there who take religion seriously enough that it's not very pragmatic to mock them in public.  It's not like you have to fall back on his religion to make Romney look ridiculous, anyway.
I think it's more that the title it's without context rather than being misleading. The title just quotes Romney.  I didn't interpret that to mean he running to make money at all (he's a billionaire for chrissake -- who becomes president for the $$?)
They can't fathom that, there are many people who have conservative parents or upbringing, and yet became liberals because /r/politics is not distorting information, it's linking to well-researched news articles by journalists. In the age of the internet, we can check and verify, the truthfulness of /r/politics, and yet these people are flat out saying "LIBERAL MEDIA"; one person in /r/askreddit, got downvoted for saying 'liberal media myth', and people accused him of liberal bias. Anything that doesn't fit their conservative worldview == liberal bias and thus false!
We're calling them "Low information voters" until the middle of November when it's okay to offend them again.
What I can't figure out -- and I've spoken to a number of teachers about it, and no one knows -- is who actually believes this bullshit.  Someone, somewhere, is making policy that no one can fail, that the tests are unfair, that if the material were just taught differently than every child would be smart.  But I don't know who these people are, or why they believe this way.  Hell, I can't even figure out who decided they should stop keeping score in softball; everyone acknowledges that it's bullshit, but that's just the way it's played now.
To be fair, what about all the black voters that came out in 2008 that never voted a day in their life? I do understand that it's a bit different coming from a minority group. On the other hand, I don't feel like the same voters would come out if it was someone like Herman Cain.
the polls are incredibly inaccurate. take this poll for instance, it's the only poll putting Romney ahead.
It's the same brain washing that keeps kids in at night and teaches them to brush their teeth, so let's not take that thought process TOO far.  It comes down to humans being limited in their abilities.  The spectrum is so wide, so vast that anyone wanting to cast a wide political net must first chose to generalized a possibly misleading message, and every political message needs a boogey-man.  When you look at the messages closely it's clear - Democrats blame the republicans, themselves and the past.  The republicans blame anyone but themselves at all costs, and they almost always blame the opponent as a part of their opening line, and then go on to vaguely offer a solution, to be explained and executed AFTER the republican is placed in office.  I'm not saying the democrats are being honest or informed in their description of the placed blame, but I am saying that when a kid comes up to you and blames everyone in the world but himself for the broken lamp, it's pretty clear what happened. Now in this scenario with a broken lamp, a kid with an excuse, and mom the results are clear, but what if this house is full of a LOT of other kids and some adults, but everyone gets equal votes?  That kid with the explanation of what went wrong simply has to speak more loudly and keep his story on track to convince enough OTHER kids that his story is true.  That is the simple method in which the republicans ensure the race will always be close these days, vague up the message to everyone, relying on how busy and uninformed people HAVE to be thanks to the limitations of humans in a drowning economy, and always blame the other guy no matter what.  The only thing that can bring down this type of play is an informed public, and so far we ain't gettin' that.

But it's totally true.  The money is in Washington.  And every President, Senator and Congressmen participates in the corruption.  Even your grand leader ___ (enter name here) is corrupt.  You want real change you need to understand that almost everything you learn in school is a lie to brainwash you into a system of slavery.  Once you know that to be true you can start re-learning the truths of the world and help wake up others.  The only way to change and be free is to educate everyone in what it means to be free.  Religion and Government are here to control you.  These elections mean nothing.  Whoever you vote for will not change things for the better for you, but only change things for the government by consolidation.  The govenment will get bigger and control more and more and make more laws.  And you will still be a worker.  The education system is here to indoctrinate you into thinking you can't survive without being someone's employee - IE: someones slave.  It's never about you being free to live without needing to be an employee.  You don't get taught to own your own land, farm and grow food for yourself.  It's always about you working for someone else, getting paid money to go to the store to buy their crap that you could have grown yourself.   Learn what Serfdom means.  Obama is for big corporations, war, wallstreet, and bailouts for bankers.  Romney is the same.  Make no mistake they are the same.  They want war and money and they don't give a damn about you.  They never did.  Grow up.

Why are there still monkeys - We didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and monkeys have a common ancestor. Asking why are there still monkeys is like asking if you came from your cousin, why are your cousins still here -- it's nonsensical.
What humans have a problem in accepting, is the concept that the universe contains the physics that create time and space; it's impossible for us to really grasp the concept of something from nothing, or nothingness itself because we've never experienced nothing, or anything that has no external form.  *if you die and are nothing, the brain cannot reconcile that notion to anything its ever experienced; how can something like our conscious mind become nothing?  It's far easier to think that we are transformed into something else which allows our conscious mind to carry on to eternity (whatever that actually means).

If we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?  Um.  Well, I don't believe we did come from monkeys, so this is a moot question.  But assuming that I did not believe, according to my understanding of evolution, it's not so much that people came from monkeys, but rather that they shared a similar ancestor.
Yes I have.  I don't know if it's real or not, but to me and what I believe in, it changes nothing.

Someone incredibly familiar with the IEM here. It has nothing to do with corn futures. The reason it isn't regulated is because traders can only invest $500. Anything more than that and the CFTC would consider them a gambling house. Honestly, it is 100% betting on the election, but it's used for research and they don't make a profit, so the CFTC says it's cool.
On top of that, Nate Silver would seem to justify Reddit's bias.
I'm currently reading Nate Silver's book, and it's fascinating to see all of the different factors that must be aggregated to make these predictions.  Very interesting stuff.
The media likes to emphasize the popular vote because it's a lot closer than the electoral vote. If people think Obama has it all sewn up they might stop watching the circus.
This personalization has a really negative effect on how we are informed as citizens. Just by browsing Reddit, you'll passively reinforce particular existing views - and even radicalize them. Without any content to counter or challenge the things we want to see, Reddit essentially becomes an echo chamber. We hear what we already think because the website is personalized to us, and because we hear it again, we think it's right. This effect is vastly compounded if Reddit is your only source of news. Because there is no overarching content control, there is no pressure to supply the other side(s) to issues.
Every time I've posted something that's portrays Obama, Liz Warren, etc in a negative light (which always comes from a good source) it's not only not upvoted, it's actively downvoted by numerous people.
I would love a more neutral subreddit with stricter rules on fact checking and serious comments (no puns, lame jokes and other meaningless posts), because it's almost as bad as /r/athesim in there.
There is also an age component at play here.  Reddit's demographic skews toward liberalism.  It also skews heavily toward those who are just out of college or just starting out in careers, aren't making any money yet and feel powerless.  Those folks, by and large, aren't voting for Romney.
There was an article that went out last week that researched Romney's remark during the debate about the President's pension. Politifact looked into it and found out Obama's pension is set up through the Cayman islands with investments in China. It's also much larger than Romney's. This isn't necessarily the Presidents fault as it's a blind investment setup through Illinois but highly hypocritical of his administration to criticize Romney for the same thing.
I was hoping it would garner some actual discussion (and vitriol) but apparently the post just got largely ignored. I suspect it  would have been on the top of /r/politics for weeks if it was Romney. Honestly I think /r/politics should have it's name changed.
Except the point about American politics being shifted right still stands when you look globally comparing America to other Western nations. The point about a shift to the left does not exist when you look outside the US. Seems like one side has a bit more support for it's case.
Except it's not a point of view, it's a fact. In the "left" / "right" political spectrum the true far left would be your socialism/communism (and don't forget anarcho-syndicalist-communes, lol). In meaningful use of the political spectrum there's no confusion.
I think it's the vote system that fucks everything up. It's meant to be used to vote discussions to the top, but it's used to vote dissenting opinions out of existence. Downvoting things you don't personally agree with is not what the system is in place for, but that's sure as hell how it's used.
Rather, it's just "Their conditions are different.  Case closed.  The end.".
I've noticed the whole Romney-is-evil thing here as well, but what's more troubling to me about political discourse on Reddit is how conservatives as a whole are treated. Reading comments on r/politics, you'd think that there's absolutely no logical basis for a conservative ideology. Sure, I disagree with most of what the GOP currently stands for, but it's possible to agree with the party and be an intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate person. Reading Reddit, you don't get a sense of any of that.
Maybe, but since the start of the month Obama has the lead in 4 polls compared to Romney's 8. Most of these leads on both sides are within the margin of error, but still I'd say it's more likely to go for Romney.
However, polls always have a margin of error, and even that margin of error is not an absolute indicator due to the confidence margin or whatever the statistical term is. I.e. a poll can have a 4 point margin of error but a 1 in 20 chance of being off the mark anyways, I think it's called a p-value, I never actually had a class on it all.
Well, seeing as a ton of the posts from r/politics are just retarded blogs, and at least 50% of the posts are filled with top comments saying "this article is complete bullshit" with intelligent discussion as to why, and then the second or third top comment is "People need to see this and wake up! This country is being destroyed. We aren't free! Romney will destroy us all!" I think it's safe to say that we are incredibly distorted. Not that others aren't, but if you believe Reddit isn't a source with a huge democratic bias, you probably don't value facts that much when it comes to making up your mind about something.  The truth and lies that a news article is composed of is like a smoothie of propaganda, which is which is only distinguishable if you put in the time to check sources, reliability, and how much facts are stretched.
On the other hand it's very comfy to be around people whom you agree with, and it creates a nice, self-perpetuating bubble of smug arrogance (as in my post). It does not mean it's not true, but it can make yourself feel more important than you really are.
I also think there's an element of arrogance involved as well. In the sense that it's unacceptable to admit something as important as an American Election could be so one-sided and predictable. American pop culture is all about drama, drama, drama; and there's no drama in a predictable outcome.

Hi Mr Roberts! First I want to thank you for doing this AMA and also for being so brave and challenging the industry and it's BS console focused mindset. This project is one that I personally had given up on ever seeing and I believe it will have a massive impact on the future of gaming. I am very excited.
And an advice about translating the game in other languages if I may: Please keep the names of the cities, planets and other stuff in the original language. WoW made that mistake and it's really annoying and confusing with all the different names of the cities for example.
Will we be able to build as well as purchase? I don't mean in the RTS sense, but will we be able to establish our own base of operations, in the sense that it's not a ship, but a stationary base?
Also, IIRC, it's been stated that in engagements, 'slots' will be reserved for your friends to jump in and help. Does this mean it won't be a 'come and go as you please' universe or am I just mistaken, which I probably am. Already gonna buy, but this clarification would just get me all the more titalated. Thanks!
Or are you aiming at some other point in the spectrum?  I watched the S42 trailer many, many times, and the speeds and distances involved look similar to WCP, but I know it's very early stage and still a prototype tech demo.  Just wanted to know if the trailer is representative of the combat pacing you're aiming for.
First off, thank you for doing this AMA and the work you’ve done in the past. My questions focus primarily on some of the less space sim-y aspects of Star Citizen. I apologize if these questions have already been asked, it's hard to keep track of all the information. If you could answer just one or two I’d appreciate it.
This game seems ambitious on a scale we haven't seen before.  MMO/single/super detail/super fast/open ended it seems like it's tackling every angle at once.
-I feel like doing the 5$ = __ credits right away is removing the "I've earned this item because of my skills/time spent ingame". Do you think it's ahred amongst player, and if so, how are you going to solve that?
I was wondering if you were planning to implement TrackIR support. You're a PC man and I'm assuming you've heard of the device. I know it's not mega-popular, but it enahances the immersion in games in a way I can't even describe.
Also, how in-depth will customization go in the game? Will it only be "skin deep" with colors and such? I understand that the ships have a large number of modeled parts for realistic damage, but could we be provided with a modular custom ship creator? Say I save up a massive amount of money, could I build a custom Cruiser with a small landing bay in back for one or two fighters? Maybe there would be a buch of prefabricated rooms, engines, features and armament that I could arrange how I wanted and then give it it's armored skin over top to finish construction. Is this idea possible? Not possible? Why?
The original Wing Commander and it's sequels were hugely influential on my life.  I credit my career in IT directly with the skills and lessons I learned while learning how to make these games run properly on various computers over the years.
I just want to say, you are amazing!!! I am still playing freelancer (discovery mod) since its really the only space sim that gets it right. It has held up amazingly well for being such an old game, and I'm so excited for the improvements you're bringing to Star Citizen. As an engineer, the fly by wire system has me really excited! I absolutely cannot wait to play this game, and I'm even considering buying a dedicated gaming rig just to play it in all it's glory!

You forgot to put words over it. Reddit won't upvote comments like this unless it's a gif or reiterates the message on the picture.
"This guy is right, for once it's not a video or story about a girl being shot or raped, good on us, for once."
As it seems like none of my previous classmates are redditors I feel it's my duty to defend my school against some of the less constructive comments.
This is Witney M. Young high school and it's a magnet school in Chicago. Top 3 in the city, 4th in the state, and around 135 in the nation. It's pretty funny reading a bunch of comments about this "inner city" school, when in fact the majority of the students in that video are probably enrolled in AP classes and will receive offers of enrollment from some of the top universities in the country.
To be fair, it's not really reddit logic. It's the American middle-class suburb logic.
Haha thank you. Although I do provide some evidence in some of my replies to back up the claim that this school is supposed to be good. But I don't see how it's not believable that a video of kids being kids (not really kids) can come from a school with high test scores. No matter where you are, at the ages of 14–18 you're going to do ridiculous things and be rowdy. In fact, you probably know that in these schools no one really causes trouble, so that's why the teachers don't shut it down right away because they know it probably won't get too out of control despite how loud it is. I'm guessing within a minute after the video stopped, some high up faculty walks by, tells them to quiet down, and everyone goes back to being normal.
Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
What makes you think it's from the inner city?
If you serve someone back after getting served, then it's on.
Wait... so high school today really IS like it's portrayed in those stupid dance movies?
Just wait until you see their football games. It's not about football at all, it's just an opportunity for each school's marching band to compete with each other.
Oh it's on.
Oh...it's on!
but now it's on....

This is an MRI scan, so it's a cross sectional image.
Exactly. There's no doubt that one is bigger than the other but as far as comparisons go, you can't go in too much details since it's not the same cut.
Correct me if I'm wrong [edit: I am wrong, see /u/Mansy's comment below], but I don't think this isn't an MRI scan. I think it's images taken in a method akin to the Visible Human Project - literally images of frozen cadavers which are photographed cross-sectionally, then a layer is removed (destructively), a new photo taken and so on and so forth.
it's hard to see the plane in which these are taken, but I think those are eyes.
Being fat is unhealthy, same as smoking. We should ultimately respect people's decisions, but I don't see how it's unreasonable to suggest that overweight people lose some weight.
So it's farts.
Jesus the human heart is huge, it's weirding me out man
yeah, I once saw a scan of my chest and all I though was "damn, what the hell is this thing? it's freakin huge!" ... "oh, that's the heart?? :o"
it's all good, You left it on, but you also left the side door open, so I walked in and turned it off.
No, it's more than just that. Look at the muscle development on the interior side of the ankles, and the shape of the ankles themselves. Her disorders are related to more than just being overweight, although i'm sure it's adding additional strain and not improving her situation.
I know jack about MRIs but I'm guessing it's only because of how the MRI take's a 'slice'. It's probably the same reason why the arm bones aren't visible on each women, since they would be angled downwards while laying on a table
It is not healthy that fat people have larger hearts. It's the body's way of adapting to needing to supply more blood. When the heart does this, it is prone to heart-attacks and cardiovascular diseases. Being obese puts tremendous strain on the heart, so no, it's not healthy.
See, it's not bullying.
Yes, it's visceral fat (fat that surrounds the organs). It's very unhealthy to have a significant amount of visceral fat because your body faces a huge risk in heart problems, diabetes and various other health issues.
If it's a CT scan, dark areas are less dense.  You can usually tell if a person has gas by a black area in the stomach.  (disclaimer: I am not a radiologist).  If dark area was shit, then this person inhaled a ton of it into her lungs.
If it's a CT scan ... I suck at reading MRI's though.
No, it's just air. Unfortunately, you won't be able to say "Fat girls are full of shit, I've seen it!"
yeah, i have the same problem getting through doorways as well. not because i'm so large (since i'm 1% bodyfat) but because my dick is 36 inches long and always erect. it's very hard traversing through tight knit indoor environments and sharp turns when you have that much sway and inertia in your lower body.

Gaga has a pretty great voice, it's just not as unique as Adele's-
I think the music biz really is like this. Some guy thought that the "lady gaga" marketing campaign is what was needed. Was it? Would more people have liked her original image? No one can truly say. I think that the perception of the gatekeeper has much more to do with what is inflicted upon us than the reality of what people really like. I mean, it's not as if Adele needed to be marketed as Princess Delly or something with backup dancers in tow.
Yeah, except the whole child prodigy thing. I'm not a fan of her or her music but she apparently has some serious chops. Also pop music is meant to be superficial and vapid. Consequently it's also designed to make a lot of money as well. During every part of modern music there are people that hear whatever is popular and decry how it's leading to the decay of society. It's just not true. Jazz and Rock n' Roll were supposed to lead to the doom of the world, but that never happened. Basically you just shouldn't make sweeping generalizations like that based on the like 2 songs you heard from her.
As a competent guitar player, I'm at the point where I don't like certain players because of the knowledge that being a musician imparts to me. For me one of these players is Slash. As a rock band, G'n'R is pretty great, but I can't just listen to them without analyzing Slash's playing. It sounds good, but it's not great in the guitar realm. When my relatives found out I was a guitar player they all seemed to jump on the "play me Sweet Child" bandwagon but when I explained that I didn't know it because I didn't like Slash, their response was akin to "shut up, he's famous and you're not, so he's done something right."
Meanwhile I was studying SRV, BB King, Townshend, and Hendrix who are arguably more important to rock than Slash. Can you see the disconnect here? It's not even a matter of talent unless the "victim" (for lack of a better word) is going around saying how much better they are than x or y; it's usually a matter of taste.
Let's be honest...lyrically and musically speaking it's all been done before and pretty much half the insane bullshit she does was done by Madonna before her.
oh hey look it's a normal hot person
Oh ok so because you like Bowies music more, so it's ok for him to act weird
the reason she became famous was because of her standing out. She HAD to stand out against the competition, otherwise no one would hear her, she was just another "aspiring" musician. Now, she's a somebody. She has a name. She can be normal if she wants to, but I think she enjoys being OTT, she knows it's working, she makes the headlines with every new outfit she comes up with. Plus, it must be fantastic to be a celebrity and have NO ONE recodnise you out of your "image" :)

...With Reddit's ability to hit on anyone as soon as they find out someone's a woman?
I definitely understand where you're coming from and I appreciate the sentiment. I just feel sad when I look at myself and don't see what I would like. I've gotten over any embarrassment with regards to what others think. I'd really like to just be happy with what I have, and most of the time it's not on my mind at all, but if I'm being honest I'd love to fill in shirts and dresses better, not bust out of them, but just fit properly so they aren't hanging off of me. I hate clothes shopping and that's a big part of why, nothing is really designed for flat girls. Not in my income range anyway.
it's ok. small chested girls make me have a sad too.
It's probably because for her, it's about what she likes, not about what you do.
I don't think it's what she likes.  I think it's what she thinks that the world likes.
That's not a good thing. It's like saying, "Your breasts are so small, it's just like you had breast cancer and got them removed!"
Next time my girlfriend complains about her boobs I'll let her know that it's OK, at least she can wear suspenders.
Not that it's really the same thing but that's like telling a fat person "don't worry there's a ton of people who have fat fetishes!"
Obviously having small boobs is commonly more preferred than being fat but it's still not a super conforming sentiment.
Yeah, the way I see it.......okay, it's nice that you and others like small boobs, that people find them attractive. But I don't. And I'm the one who has to live with 'em.
Definitely still need a sports bra - though you're right that it's probably no where near as uncomfortable. They still bounce a little bit.
Not that I play golf but I've heard that it's also easier with small breasts.

It seems like it's always 8/10
It's not really that we have a monopoly on Reddit's advertising system, it's just that there are not a lot of advertisers on Reddit in general. We actually pay the minimum amount required per day to advertise ($30 per subreddit), and are usually competing with a few different ads each day. Redditors love the site, the 5K+ upvotes and comments are all legit (as krispykrackers confirmed above), and this ad brings us a ton of new visitors, so it's worthwhile for us to keep this ad running every day.
It's because it's the same thread being promoted, those are the same comments you see everytime.

"Apelsin - Kolsyrad läskedryck" Basically means that it's orange flavored carbonated soda.
Not that anyone would likely crack it open and drink it... but if it's been in storage for roughly as long as it is old without severe agitation, all the syrup and additives have come out of suspension... the top part is all carbonated water, and the lower part is all syrup and coloring.
I cracked a Pepsi from dad's cupboard and realized that the soda was bland-- thought, "oh... it's just caffeine free... and flavor free."  So I poured it in the sink and it came out clear followed by brown sludge.
There is a protective liner along the inside of the can, protecting the metal from the liquid, however it is easily punctured, particularly if the can has ever been dented (either by you or somewhere along the process shipping from the factory to the store). Once that happens, it's not a question of if but when it will begin to leak everywhere and destroy everything you hold dear.

Your park rating will drop, but it's oh so fun.
It was one of those deals where they released almost the exact same game but with a few minor changes and called it '2'. There are new rides and things, it's more or less an expansion park.
The only really notable difference is that you could stack scenery. In the first one you could only build little walls on the grass, but once you are able to stack scenery, you can work upward too, so it allowed you to build little houses and things, with roofs and that. This made little difference to the game, but once the modding community got hold of it, they made their own scenery, and used this new stacking ability to make incredibly complex structures and things. Just take a look at the links I provided, it's amazing, but still so time consuming; each piece on each square is placed by hand.
But you're forgetting it's called Universe Sandbox.

That's what reddit's for.
Actually, it's >7 billion now.
Every 150 minutes there is 1 year of video uploaded, that is INCREDIBLE. My mind is blown just trying to comprehend consuming that much content and it's uploaded EVERY 150 minutes!
Reddit isn't useful to me because it's a link aggregator or a forum. It's useful because it's a scalable and universal system for screening content, from videos to products to music or fashion. Google has spent the last few years trying to tackle "social search." Reddit ended up doing by accident.
With inflation it's more like over 9.86 based on this huffpost article.
The problem that drives reposts isn't a lack of content - it's a lack of good content, and good ways to separate the good from the bad. The reason we get reposts is that they've already gotten past the "is this good or bad?" filter, and so can be depended on. If good content is a needle in a stack of shit, then reposts are all those needles that have been painstakingly grabbed from the shit and already set aside.
If you filter out videos of cats and crap lets plays, it's about 30 minutes.
This is strongly in line with the lifestyle of it's founder and CEO, Tristam Shandy.

Ya know sometimes, as a parent, it's just better to let your kid not eat their peas and green beans if they don't want to.
Because parents are supposed to be proud when their children kill or die for their country, not when they speak up when it's illegal or may offend people.
the speaking up I can deal with it's their right as humans to do so, the breaking and entering, destruction of property and assault I cannot.
It's an acceptable form of justice as far as I'm concerned since it's not changing the law it's just bending it so it doesn't create any dangerous precedents (i.e. they would of been charged with what they were charged with regardless but likely wouldn't of gotten anywhere near the max sentence if it wasn't for all this other stuff I'm guessing).
No. Tolokonnikova was one of the founders and leaders, not simply a member. Samutsevich was one of the other members of Voina as you can see from their video and photo reports. As for other two pussy riot members (one of which wasn't caught), it's not clear at all, since neither group has listed their membership for their own safety sake.
Because it's a horrible travesty to the values of the civilized and democratic world, which Russia half-heartedly pretends to be a part of.
I was born in the Soviet Union, and I guess it's clear why the West abandoned us after World War 2.
They're not progressive. They have never fought for anything in their lives. They're a typical US shopper/worker with a cozy priviliged life. In a bubble like that it's difficult to understand.
You're right, but as I said a few times now, it's almost guaranteed that their previous criminal history comes into consideration when a sentence is being handed down hence the 2 years they received.
Fun fact: there's a purposefully funny Russian dub of the Lord of the Rings, and Mordor becomes Mordovia, Gondor becomes Honduras, etc. In Russian it's hilarious.
I'm glad to have more facts, glad to have read the article. But I found it grating that the author emphasized what the facilities used to be used for by a different government. I get the symbolism here. The right way to handle this is to point out the symbolism and then report accurately about the current conditions at these facilities. Propaganda bothers me, even when it's for "my side."
This may be true, but to put bullshit quoted by them in the headline in such a way will make it seem like it's the truth.  Such a line should be in the article, and it should be followed with a debunking, but it shouldn't be the headline, as that will mislead people and the media knows this.
... but it's for their "singing", and not their activism, so it's completely justified.
that raises the question about the legitimacy of the protest, not the power => it's counterproductive

Use sacrificial drone comb - make absolutely sure it's removed while brood still capped
Interesting other issue are bats are coming down with the white nose syndrome (fungus) which is killing them off. They eat insects, and it's entirely possible that not only are we killing insects but in turn we are killing the animals that eat insects, too.
Maybe it's just me but I never really understood why people thought it was a great idea to spray poison all over and why they are surprised when it kills things. I mean, it doesn't take "human poison" to kill me - could be rat poison, could be weed poison, could be bug poison. Likewise with other life forms.
That's not what I meant, I guess I was unclear. What I meant is that it's unsurprising to me that pesticide and herbicide causes massive "collateral damage" to bees, seeing as how pesticide and herbicide at those levels would cause the same damage to most animals.
Sorry, I guess my comment was unclear. What I mean is that since obviously we spend some effort checking crops to make sure that the very small levels of residual pesticide/herbicide do not harm humans, it's utterly unsurprising that much higher levels of pesticide and herbicide harm bees.
Those insects become resistant to that pesticide (or it's found to be too toxic) and they stop it's use, and use something else.  And the cycle repeats.
someone finds a new article, or a new article finds old research.  And every time informed people groan because it's fairly well established as a bunch of causes, and pesticides aren't necessarily even a top one.
This research is important and novel because it's replicating field-level exposures on bumblebee colonies of two pesticides (a neonicitinoid and a pyrethroid) in combination as well as individually, this hasn't been done before.
Heck it's one of the reasons GM foods are so important. Because the current nuke spray effect of pesticides is far more harmful then the controlled levels plants naturally produce, and if we can replicate nature, it'll probably be better for everyone.
I don't think news articles paint the picture right.  There's company involvement all over the place, but most farms, in the states I have lived in, are actually owned and operated by farmers, then they give their crops to a pool/company that distributes.  If a company owns a farm, it's a company started by the family that started the farm.  I have two grandmothers that own a substantial amount of family farms, which act as their retirement income.  The farm is still mostly operated by family members though.
So since Agent Orange is a defoliant it's safe to eat.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11vz4g/amazon_closes_womans_account_and_wipes_her_kindle/
According to this interview with Linn, it appears that she bought her first Kindle used,  so it's not entirely inconceivable that it's related to the account tied to the previous owner of that Kindle.
I should add that in addition to emailing, I did call, several times. While it's hard to say if it helped, it was definitely more helpful than emailing.
I only got back a really surley fuck you type message. So then I inquired again politely and got the same shitty response back. Took the gloves off and, without any actual threats, etc mind you, just a bit of a tyraid on how they could treat their customers this way it's not right, etc etc, some tech emails me back saying I'm being threatening and has called the cops on me.
Amazon is now going to release a statement explaining what happened, and it's going to turn out that this woman's Credit Card information has been used in multiple other accounts and Amazon was basically just shutting down all the accounts so that card can't be used anymore on their site.
THAT SAID, how Amazon's handling this is bullshit and they should absolutely be providing her with enough information to know exactly what's going on.  Plus, of course, it's rather troubling to think that your Kindle and everything you purchased for it could be wiped out entirely at the whim of Amazon, with no recourse besides legal action.
Either way, while I'm not saying it's impossible this is 100% an error on Amazon's part, I'm still guessing there's more to the story on the customer's end than we're hearing.
I had a similar problem with Amazon, I think for them it's par for the course to not provide any details why they close an account. I tried calling them a few times - at one time one of the customer reps said that there was no problem with my account, but with an account from a customer in another city who has the same name as I do. (Fine, I have an relatively unusual name, but not that unusual. And really - the credit card details say where I live, so why is that an issue?)
In my experience it's fairly typical for large companies not to provide details in cases which are related to some kind of account fraud or related abuse. The more details they make available, the more vulnerable their detection tech is to gaming by scammers.
It's pretty baffling all around, so don't think I'm defending Amazon TOO much here.  I'm just saying, it's still safe to assume that companies have a purpose to their actions, at least most of the time.
With that said, this post is disturbing.  Regardless of whether she did or didn't do something wrong, or Amazon simply made a mistake, it's not good that we're headed in a direction where large corporations "own" what you "buy" and have the ability to repossess or destroy it with no explanation, no due process and no viable recourse.
I'm sure I've used terms like "purchased" to describe digital media before. I just wanted to use this opportunity to point out the distinction to people who might not otherwise know about it, because it's very relevant to the discussion at hand.
That's probably the most sensible idea. If she lost enough to be worth her time then she should at least contact the amazon legal department and say if it's not sorted out then she will take legal action.
See, the problem is, when I see Amazon could suspend my account by mistake and deny me access to the stuff I bought from them, not tell me why or otherwise try to help fix the mistake, and my only recourse would be to get a lawyer and perhaps go to court, as a potential customer it just doesn't make me want to do business with them. It's too risky and complicated. And it's their loss more than it is mine.
Digital media with restrictions like this should be treated for what they are: rentals. As such, they are only deserving of a rental's price. This is why I never spend more than $10 for a Steam game, or $1-2 for an eBook. If it's not mine, then it's still the seller's, in which case they don't deserve full price for it.
Interestingly enough, only Apple has thus far actually moved to a model embracing technology's strengths without the inane restrictions, but even there it's only with music (and still limited to lossy formats).
This. Also, it's not Amazon deciding on whether an e-book should have DRM or not, it's the publishers. Amazon's actually been fighting a huge legal battle against the publishers, in behalf of their customers to prevent the fucked-up pricing that's been happening (e-books costing as much, and sometimes more than the hard cover version).
The point here isn't who caused the problem, the point here is that Amazon isn't even trying to help this customer fix it. The worst part, for me, is where they stated that "any subsequent account" would be closed as well. What the actual fuck? This is essentially banning the person altogether. I don't think it's wrong to terminate the account of someone who broke the rules, but to keep terminating any new accounts after they've learned a lesson? That's just mean and hostile. And especially so if you refuse to tell the person why you banned them to begin with.
It's shitty, but well within the terms of service, and it's something people should be aware of before they tie so much of their life/purchases to an account that could be closed on a whim.
The problem is when problems occur which the customer service agent in India isn't capable of solving.  This is when you see the beautiful surface of Amazon peel away and what's left is a rotten core of cold heartless automation, the Hades of customer service.  By definition you will get absolutely no assistance here because it's completely devoid of human thought or compassion; again, Amazon is built to ignore the most time consuming customers.  They don't want you, and thus your complaints will be met with mindless form emails until you give up and leave.  Amazon: 1, Annoying Customer: 0.
Believe it or not, I still shop at Amazon because their shopping system is far and away the best.  And if something goes wrong I'm sure I can usually get a decent remedy.  But I have no illusions about the way the company works behind the scenes.  I hope nobody here personally has to deal with Amazon on the same level I did, because it's hell.
No, but it's how many businesses behave as soon as there is the slightest whiff of something that interests the "security" department.
It's usually an issue of some dipshit who loves the power they have to close accounts and goes overboard in assuming somethings bad or fishy when it's not. Once these folks close accounts, it usually took someone higher up like me to MAKE them understand they did a bad thing and open the account back up. Even then, they would smirk and say they weren't wrong. It was absurd.
E: Looks like the Internet killed the blog site. Basically it's someone saying Amazon killed his friend's account and remotely wiped her Kindle because the account was 'related to an existing closed account', and in the following email chain tells her any future accounts will also be closed and refuses to tell her any further details and ends with "we're not going to discuss the matter further" and "thank you for understanding our decision"
Yeah, I mean it's not like they are playing fair. It's a capitalist system, it pays off to be an opportunist, they take advantages of the system and it's fine. But when your avarage Joe does it, it is wrong?
I also don't like this weird digital-age notion content producers have that they can take back what they sold you. If a copy of a file on your computer is considered an "item" (as they insist it is when pirates "publish" millions of copies), and you've bought it, then it's theft for them to take it back. Imagine if publishers (or recording studios, or movie studios) were allowed to walk into your home and box up your books, movies, and DVDs. I would call the goddamn cops on them, and they would go to jail, because that's theft.
She probably violated some form of terms or contract a person does when registering their product. Rarely happens, except they took action. They may not be informing her of her breach do to reason of pursuing other activity related to her account. Although not fair it's my game plan if I was Amazon. Possible she was taking copywritten material and posting that data elsewhere. Uploading to torrents. Honestly a little extreme.

What wouldn't surprise me is hearing something equivalent from Obama. After 3 thankless years of trying to turn around problems he didn't create, while taking all the blame for it, he's still out there campaigning and trying to do the job again. Fucking amazing that he isn't up there going "Hey Romney it's all yours. Good luck, buddy. I'm going to go sit on a beach and watch the world burn."
He's saying the salesman needs to make more money for his family for when he dies. I mean it's either cars or blue meth.
That's because it's been conveniently left out of the media narrative.
Mitt Romney was born in 1947, meaning he would have been 19 in 1966. Age 19 is exactly in the age range where every male member of the LDS church goes on a mission. It's not "convenient", it's just how LDS missions work.
Former Mormon here, not every 19 year old boy goes on a mission, it's a choice. So he clearly chose to do that while avoiding the draft. There were plenty of men that chose the opposite even though they were Mormon 19 year olds.
The problem isn't just in the federal government as an organism, it's in individual government officials that have no integrity.
Unfortunately, there are enough people out there who take religion seriously enough that it's not very pragmatic to mock them in public.  It's not like you have to fall back on his religion to make Romney look ridiculous, anyway.
I think it's more that the title it's without context rather than being misleading. The title just quotes Romney.  I didn't interpret that to mean he running to make money at all (he's a billionaire for chrissake -- who becomes president for the $$?)
They can't fathom that, there are many people who have conservative parents or upbringing, and yet became liberals because /r/politics is not distorting information, it's linking to well-researched news articles by journalists. In the age of the internet, we can check and verify, the truthfulness of /r/politics, and yet these people are flat out saying "LIBERAL MEDIA"; one person in /r/askreddit, got downvoted for saying 'liberal media myth', and people accused him of liberal bias. Anything that doesn't fit their conservative worldview == liberal bias and thus false!
We're calling them "Low information voters" until the middle of November when it's okay to offend them again.
What I can't figure out -- and I've spoken to a number of teachers about it, and no one knows -- is who actually believes this bullshit.  Someone, somewhere, is making policy that no one can fail, that the tests are unfair, that if the material were just taught differently than every child would be smart.  But I don't know who these people are, or why they believe this way.  Hell, I can't even figure out who decided they should stop keeping score in softball; everyone acknowledges that it's bullshit, but that's just the way it's played now.
To be fair, what about all the black voters that came out in 2008 that never voted a day in their life? I do understand that it's a bit different coming from a minority group. On the other hand, I don't feel like the same voters would come out if it was someone like Herman Cain.
the polls are incredibly inaccurate. take this poll for instance, it's the only poll putting Romney ahead.
It's the same brain washing that keeps kids in at night and teaches them to brush their teeth, so let's not take that thought process TOO far.  It comes down to humans being limited in their abilities.  The spectrum is so wide, so vast that anyone wanting to cast a wide political net must first chose to generalized a possibly misleading message, and every political message needs a boogey-man.  When you look at the messages closely it's clear - Democrats blame the republicans, themselves and the past.  The republicans blame anyone but themselves at all costs, and they almost always blame the opponent as a part of their opening line, and then go on to vaguely offer a solution, to be explained and executed AFTER the republican is placed in office.  I'm not saying the democrats are being honest or informed in their description of the placed blame, but I am saying that when a kid comes up to you and blames everyone in the world but himself for the broken lamp, it's pretty clear what happened. Now in this scenario with a broken lamp, a kid with an excuse, and mom the results are clear, but what if this house is full of a LOT of other kids and some adults, but everyone gets equal votes?  That kid with the explanation of what went wrong simply has to speak more loudly and keep his story on track to convince enough OTHER kids that his story is true.  That is the simple method in which the republicans ensure the race will always be close these days, vague up the message to everyone, relying on how busy and uninformed people HAVE to be thanks to the limitations of humans in a drowning economy, and always blame the other guy no matter what.  The only thing that can bring down this type of play is an informed public, and so far we ain't gettin' that.

But it's totally true.  The money is in Washington.  And every President, Senator and Congressmen participates in the corruption.  Even your grand leader ___ (enter name here) is corrupt.  You want real change you need to understand that almost everything you learn in school is a lie to brainwash you into a system of slavery.  Once you know that to be true you can start re-learning the truths of the world and help wake up others.  The only way to change and be free is to educate everyone in what it means to be free.  Religion and Government are here to control you.  These elections mean nothing.  Whoever you vote for will not change things for the better for you, but only change things for the government by consolidation.  The govenment will get bigger and control more and more and make more laws.  And you will still be a worker.  The education system is here to indoctrinate you into thinking you can't survive without being someone's employee - IE: someones slave.  It's never about you being free to live without needing to be an employee.  You don't get taught to own your own land, farm and grow food for yourself.  It's always about you working for someone else, getting paid money to go to the store to buy their crap that you could have grown yourself.   Learn what Serfdom means.  Obama is for big corporations, war, wallstreet, and bailouts for bankers.  Romney is the same.  Make no mistake they are the same.  They want war and money and they don't give a damn about you.  They never did.  Grow up.

Why are there still monkeys - We didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and monkeys have a common ancestor. Asking why are there still monkeys is like asking if you came from your cousin, why are your cousins still here -- it's nonsensical.
What humans have a problem in accepting, is the concept that the universe contains the physics that create time and space; it's impossible for us to really grasp the concept of something from nothing, or nothingness itself because we've never experienced nothing, or anything that has no external form.  *if you die and are nothing, the brain cannot reconcile that notion to anything its ever experienced; how can something like our conscious mind become nothing?  It's far easier to think that we are transformed into something else which allows our conscious mind to carry on to eternity (whatever that actually means).

Isn't it awful how that christian who wrote the thing equates homosexuality and pornography to murder and rape?

I think you have it; it's pretty weak.  Look through the blog.  Seems to be Christian baiting.

If we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?  Um.  Well, I don't believe we did come from monkeys, so this is a moot question.  But assuming that I did not believe, according to my understanding of evolution, it's not so much that people came from monkeys, but rather that they shared a similar ancestor.
Yes I have.  I don't know if it's real or not, but to me and what I believe in, it changes nothing.

Someone incredibly familiar with the IEM here. It has nothing to do with corn futures. The reason it isn't regulated is because traders can only invest $500. Anything more than that and the CFTC would consider them a gambling house. Honestly, it is 100% betting on the election, but it's used for research and they don't make a profit, so the CFTC says it's cool.
On top of that, Nate Silver would seem to justify Reddit's bias.
I'm currently reading Nate Silver's book, and it's fascinating to see all of the different factors that must be aggregated to make these predictions.  Very interesting stuff.
The media likes to emphasize the popular vote because it's a lot closer than the electoral vote. If people think Obama has it all sewn up they might stop watching the circus.
This personalization has a really negative effect on how we are informed as citizens. Just by browsing Reddit, you'll passively reinforce particular existing views - and even radicalize them. Without any content to counter or challenge the things we want to see, Reddit essentially becomes an echo chamber. We hear what we already think because the website is personalized to us, and because we hear it again, we think it's right. This effect is vastly compounded if Reddit is your only source of news. Because there is no overarching content control, there is no pressure to supply the other side(s) to issues.
Every time I've posted something that's portrays Obama, Liz Warren, etc in a negative light (which always comes from a good source) it's not only not upvoted, it's actively downvoted by numerous people.
I would love a more neutral subreddit with stricter rules on fact checking and serious comments (no puns, lame jokes and other meaningless posts), because it's almost as bad as /r/athesim in there.
There is also an age component at play here.  Reddit's demographic skews toward liberalism.  It also skews heavily toward those who are just out of college or just starting out in careers, aren't making any money yet and feel powerless.  Those folks, by and large, aren't voting for Romney.
There was an article that went out last week that researched Romney's remark during the debate about the President's pension. Politifact looked into it and found out Obama's pension is set up through the Cayman islands with investments in China. It's also much larger than Romney's. This isn't necessarily the Presidents fault as it's a blind investment setup through Illinois but highly hypocritical of his administration to criticize Romney for the same thing.
I was hoping it would garner some actual discussion (and vitriol) but apparently the post just got largely ignored. I suspect it  would have been on the top of /r/politics for weeks if it was Romney. Honestly I think /r/politics should have it's name changed.
Except the point about American politics being shifted right still stands when you look globally comparing America to other Western nations. The point about a shift to the left does not exist when you look outside the US. Seems like one side has a bit more support for it's case.
Except it's not a point of view, it's a fact. In the "left" / "right" political spectrum the true far left would be your socialism/communism (and don't forget anarcho-syndicalist-communes, lol). In meaningful use of the political spectrum there's no confusion.
I think it's the vote system that fucks everything up. It's meant to be used to vote discussions to the top, but it's used to vote dissenting opinions out of existence. Downvoting things you don't personally agree with is not what the system is in place for, but that's sure as hell how it's used.
Rather, it's just "Their conditions are different.  Case closed.  The end.".
I've noticed the whole Romney-is-evil thing here as well, but what's more troubling to me about political discourse on Reddit is how conservatives as a whole are treated. Reading comments on r/politics, you'd think that there's absolutely no logical basis for a conservative ideology. Sure, I disagree with most of what the GOP currently stands for, but it's possible to agree with the party and be an intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate person. Reading Reddit, you don't get a sense of any of that.
Maybe, but since the start of the month Obama has the lead in 4 polls compared to Romney's 8. Most of these leads on both sides are within the margin of error, but still I'd say it's more likely to go for Romney.
However, polls always have a margin of error, and even that margin of error is not an absolute indicator due to the confidence margin or whatever the statistical term is. I.e. a poll can have a 4 point margin of error but a 1 in 20 chance of being off the mark anyways, I think it's called a p-value, I never actually had a class on it all.
Well, seeing as a ton of the posts from r/politics are just retarded blogs, and at least 50% of the posts are filled with top comments saying "this article is complete bullshit" with intelligent discussion as to why, and then the second or third top comment is "People need to see this and wake up! This country is being destroyed. We aren't free! Romney will destroy us all!" I think it's safe to say that we are incredibly distorted. Not that others aren't, but if you believe Reddit isn't a source with a huge democratic bias, you probably don't value facts that much when it comes to making up your mind about something.  The truth and lies that a news article is composed of is like a smoothie of propaganda, which is which is only distinguishable if you put in the time to check sources, reliability, and how much facts are stretched.
On the other hand it's very comfy to be around people whom you agree with, and it creates a nice, self-perpetuating bubble of smug arrogance (as in my post). It does not mean it's not true, but it can make yourself feel more important than you really are.
I also think there's an element of arrogance involved as well. In the sense that it's unacceptable to admit something as important as an American Election could be so one-sided and predictable. American pop culture is all about drama, drama, drama; and there's no drama in a predictable outcome.

Hi Mr Roberts! First I want to thank you for doing this AMA and also for being so brave and challenging the industry and it's BS console focused mindset. This project is one that I personally had given up on ever seeing and I believe it will have a massive impact on the future of gaming. I am very excited.
And an advice about translating the game in other languages if I may: Please keep the names of the cities, planets and other stuff in the original language. WoW made that mistake and it's really annoying and confusing with all the different names of the cities for example.
Will we be able to build as well as purchase? I don't mean in the RTS sense, but will we be able to establish our own base of operations, in the sense that it's not a ship, but a stationary base?
Also, IIRC, it's been stated that in engagements, 'slots' will be reserved for your friends to jump in and help. Does this mean it won't be a 'come and go as you please' universe or am I just mistaken, which I probably am. Already gonna buy, but this clarification would just get me all the more titalated. Thanks!
Or are you aiming at some other point in the spectrum?  I watched the S42 trailer many, many times, and the speeds and distances involved look similar to WCP, but I know it's very early stage and still a prototype tech demo.  Just wanted to know if the trailer is representative of the combat pacing you're aiming for.
First off, thank you for doing this AMA and the work you’ve done in the past. My questions focus primarily on some of the less space sim-y aspects of Star Citizen. I apologize if these questions have already been asked, it's hard to keep track of all the information. If you could answer just one or two I’d appreciate it.
This game seems ambitious on a scale we haven't seen before.  MMO/single/super detail/super fast/open ended it seems like it's tackling every angle at once.
-I feel like doing the 5$ = __ credits right away is removing the "I've earned this item because of my skills/time spent ingame". Do you think it's ahred amongst player, and if so, how are you going to solve that?
I was wondering if you were planning to implement TrackIR support. You're a PC man and I'm assuming you've heard of the device. I know it's not mega-popular, but it enahances the immersion in games in a way I can't even describe.
Also, how in-depth will customization go in the game? Will it only be "skin deep" with colors and such? I understand that the ships have a large number of modeled parts for realistic damage, but could we be provided with a modular custom ship creator? Say I save up a massive amount of money, could I build a custom Cruiser with a small landing bay in back for one or two fighters? Maybe there would be a buch of prefabricated rooms, engines, features and armament that I could arrange how I wanted and then give it it's armored skin over top to finish construction. Is this idea possible? Not possible? Why?
The original Wing Commander and it's sequels were hugely influential on my life.  I credit my career in IT directly with the skills and lessons I learned while learning how to make these games run properly on various computers over the years.
I just want to say, you are amazing!!! I am still playing freelancer (discovery mod) since its really the only space sim that gets it right. It has held up amazingly well for being such an old game, and I'm so excited for the improvements you're bringing to Star Citizen. As an engineer, the fly by wire system has me really excited! I absolutely cannot wait to play this game, and I'm even considering buying a dedicated gaming rig just to play it in all it's glory!

You forgot to put words over it. Reddit won't upvote comments like this unless it's a gif or reiterates the message on the picture.
"This guy is right, for once it's not a video or story about a girl being shot or raped, good on us, for once."
As it seems like none of my previous classmates are redditors I feel it's my duty to defend my school against some of the less constructive comments.
This is Witney M. Young high school and it's a magnet school in Chicago. Top 3 in the city, 4th in the state, and around 135 in the nation. It's pretty funny reading a bunch of comments about this "inner city" school, when in fact the majority of the students in that video are probably enrolled in AP classes and will receive offers of enrollment from some of the top universities in the country.
To be fair, it's not really reddit logic. It's the American middle-class suburb logic.
Haha thank you. Although I do provide some evidence in some of my replies to back up the claim that this school is supposed to be good. But I don't see how it's not believable that a video of kids being kids (not really kids) can come from a school with high test scores. No matter where you are, at the ages of 14–18 you're going to do ridiculous things and be rowdy. In fact, you probably know that in these schools no one really causes trouble, so that's why the teachers don't shut it down right away because they know it probably won't get too out of control despite how loud it is. I'm guessing within a minute after the video stopped, some high up faculty walks by, tells them to quiet down, and everyone goes back to being normal.
Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
What makes you think it's from the inner city?
If you serve someone back after getting served, then it's on.
Wait... so high school today really IS like it's portrayed in those stupid dance movies?
Just wait until you see their football games. It's not about football at all, it's just an opportunity for each school's marching band to compete with each other.
Oh it's on.
Oh...it's on!
but now it's on....

This is an MRI scan, so it's a cross sectional image.
Exactly. There's no doubt that one is bigger than the other but as far as comparisons go, you can't go in too much details since it's not the same cut.
Correct me if I'm wrong [edit: I am wrong, see /u/Mansy's comment below], but I don't think this isn't an MRI scan. I think it's images taken in a method akin to the Visible Human Project - literally images of frozen cadavers which are photographed cross-sectionally, then a layer is removed (destructively), a new photo taken and so on and so forth.
it's hard to see the plane in which these are taken, but I think those are eyes.
Being fat is unhealthy, same as smoking. We should ultimately respect people's decisions, but I don't see how it's unreasonable to suggest that overweight people lose some weight.
So it's farts.
Jesus the human heart is huge, it's weirding me out man
yeah, I once saw a scan of my chest and all I though was "damn, what the hell is this thing? it's freakin huge!" ... "oh, that's the heart?? :o"
it's all good, You left it on, but you also left the side door open, so I walked in and turned it off.
No, it's more than just that. Look at the muscle development on the interior side of the ankles, and the shape of the ankles themselves. Her disorders are related to more than just being overweight, although i'm sure it's adding additional strain and not improving her situation.
I know jack about MRIs but I'm guessing it's only because of how the MRI take's a 'slice'. It's probably the same reason why the arm bones aren't visible on each women, since they would be angled downwards while laying on a table
It is not healthy that fat people have larger hearts. It's the body's way of adapting to needing to supply more blood. When the heart does this, it is prone to heart-attacks and cardiovascular diseases. Being obese puts tremendous strain on the heart, so no, it's not healthy.
See, it's not bullying.
Yes, it's visceral fat (fat that surrounds the organs). It's very unhealthy to have a significant amount of visceral fat because your body faces a huge risk in heart problems, diabetes and various other health issues.
If it's a CT scan, dark areas are less dense.  You can usually tell if a person has gas by a black area in the stomach.  (disclaimer: I am not a radiologist).  If dark area was shit, then this person inhaled a ton of it into her lungs.
If it's a CT scan ... I suck at reading MRI's though.
No, it's just air. Unfortunately, you won't be able to say "Fat girls are full of shit, I've seen it!"
yeah, i have the same problem getting through doorways as well. not because i'm so large (since i'm 1% bodyfat) but because my dick is 36 inches long and always erect. it's very hard traversing through tight knit indoor environments and sharp turns when you have that much sway and inertia in your lower body.

Gaga has a pretty great voice, it's just not as unique as Adele's-
I think the music biz really is like this. Some guy thought that the "lady gaga" marketing campaign is what was needed. Was it? Would more people have liked her original image? No one can truly say. I think that the perception of the gatekeeper has much more to do with what is inflicted upon us than the reality of what people really like. I mean, it's not as if Adele needed to be marketed as Princess Delly or something with backup dancers in tow.
Yeah, except the whole child prodigy thing. I'm not a fan of her or her music but she apparently has some serious chops. Also pop music is meant to be superficial and vapid. Consequently it's also designed to make a lot of money as well. During every part of modern music there are people that hear whatever is popular and decry how it's leading to the decay of society. It's just not true. Jazz and Rock n' Roll were supposed to lead to the doom of the world, but that never happened. Basically you just shouldn't make sweeping generalizations like that based on the like 2 songs you heard from her.
As a competent guitar player, I'm at the point where I don't like certain players because of the knowledge that being a musician imparts to me. For me one of these players is Slash. As a rock band, G'n'R is pretty great, but I can't just listen to them without analyzing Slash's playing. It sounds good, but it's not great in the guitar realm. When my relatives found out I was a guitar player they all seemed to jump on the "play me Sweet Child" bandwagon but when I explained that I didn't know it because I didn't like Slash, their response was akin to "shut up, he's famous and you're not, so he's done something right."
Meanwhile I was studying SRV, BB King, Townshend, and Hendrix who are arguably more important to rock than Slash. Can you see the disconnect here? It's not even a matter of talent unless the "victim" (for lack of a better word) is going around saying how much better they are than x or y; it's usually a matter of taste.
Let's be honest...lyrically and musically speaking it's all been done before and pretty much half the insane bullshit she does was done by Madonna before her.
oh hey look it's a normal hot person
Oh ok so because you like Bowies music more, so it's ok for him to act weird
the reason she became famous was because of her standing out. She HAD to stand out against the competition, otherwise no one would hear her, she was just another "aspiring" musician. Now, she's a somebody. She has a name. She can be normal if she wants to, but I think she enjoys being OTT, she knows it's working, she makes the headlines with every new outfit she comes up with. Plus, it must be fantastic to be a celebrity and have NO ONE recodnise you out of your "image" :)

...With Reddit's ability to hit on anyone as soon as they find out someone's a woman?
I definitely understand where you're coming from and I appreciate the sentiment. I just feel sad when I look at myself and don't see what I would like. I've gotten over any embarrassment with regards to what others think. I'd really like to just be happy with what I have, and most of the time it's not on my mind at all, but if I'm being honest I'd love to fill in shirts and dresses better, not bust out of them, but just fit properly so they aren't hanging off of me. I hate clothes shopping and that's a big part of why, nothing is really designed for flat girls. Not in my income range anyway.
it's ok. small chested girls make me have a sad too.
It's probably because for her, it's about what she likes, not about what you do.
I don't think it's what she likes.  I think it's what she thinks that the world likes.
That's not a good thing. It's like saying, "Your breasts are so small, it's just like you had breast cancer and got them removed!"
Next time my girlfriend complains about her boobs I'll let her know that it's OK, at least she can wear suspenders.
Not that it's really the same thing but that's like telling a fat person "don't worry there's a ton of people who have fat fetishes!"
Obviously having small boobs is commonly more preferred than being fat but it's still not a super conforming sentiment.
Yeah, the way I see it.......okay, it's nice that you and others like small boobs, that people find them attractive. But I don't. And I'm the one who has to live with 'em.
Definitely still need a sports bra - though you're right that it's probably no where near as uncomfortable. They still bounce a little bit.
Not that I play golf but I've heard that it's also easier with small breasts.

It seems like it's always 8/10
It's not really that we have a monopoly on Reddit's advertising system, it's just that there are not a lot of advertisers on Reddit in general. We actually pay the minimum amount required per day to advertise ($30 per subreddit), and are usually competing with a few different ads each day. Redditors love the site, the 5K+ upvotes and comments are all legit (as krispykrackers confirmed above), and this ad brings us a ton of new visitors, so it's worthwhile for us to keep this ad running every day.
It's because it's the same thread being promoted, those are the same comments you see everytime.

Because it's "Not Safe for Wallet" - it's appropriately marked.

"Apelsin - Kolsyrad läskedryck" Basically means that it's orange flavored carbonated soda.
Not that anyone would likely crack it open and drink it... but if it's been in storage for roughly as long as it is old without severe agitation, all the syrup and additives have come out of suspension... the top part is all carbonated water, and the lower part is all syrup and coloring.
I cracked a Pepsi from dad's cupboard and realized that the soda was bland-- thought, "oh... it's just caffeine free... and flavor free."  So I poured it in the sink and it came out clear followed by brown sludge.
There is a protective liner along the inside of the can, protecting the metal from the liquid, however it is easily punctured, particularly if the can has ever been dented (either by you or somewhere along the process shipping from the factory to the store). Once that happens, it's not a question of if but when it will begin to leak everywhere and destroy everything you hold dear.

Your park rating will drop, but it's oh so fun.
It was one of those deals where they released almost the exact same game but with a few minor changes and called it '2'. There are new rides and things, it's more or less an expansion park.
The only really notable difference is that you could stack scenery. In the first one you could only build little walls on the grass, but once you are able to stack scenery, you can work upward too, so it allowed you to build little houses and things, with roofs and that. This made little difference to the game, but once the modding community got hold of it, they made their own scenery, and used this new stacking ability to make incredibly complex structures and things. Just take a look at the links I provided, it's amazing, but still so time consuming; each piece on each square is placed by hand.
But you're forgetting it's called Universe Sandbox.

That's what reddit's for.
Actually, it's >7 billion now.
Every 150 minutes there is 1 year of video uploaded, that is INCREDIBLE. My mind is blown just trying to comprehend consuming that much content and it's uploaded EVERY 150 minutes!
Reddit isn't useful to me because it's a link aggregator or a forum. It's useful because it's a scalable and universal system for screening content, from videos to products to music or fashion. Google has spent the last few years trying to tackle "social search." Reddit ended up doing by accident.
With inflation it's more like over 9.86 based on this huffpost article.
The problem that drives reposts isn't a lack of content - it's a lack of good content, and good ways to separate the good from the bad. The reason we get reposts is that they've already gotten past the "is this good or bad?" filter, and so can be depended on. If good content is a needle in a stack of shit, then reposts are all those needles that have been painstakingly grabbed from the shit and already set aside.
If you filter out videos of cats and crap lets plays, it's about 30 minutes.
This is strongly in line with the lifestyle of it's founder and CEO, Tristam Shandy.

Ya know sometimes, as a parent, it's just better to let your kid not eat their peas and green beans if they don't want to.
Because parents are supposed to be proud when their children kill or die for their country, not when they speak up when it's illegal or may offend people.
the speaking up I can deal with it's their right as humans to do so, the breaking and entering, destruction of property and assault I cannot.
It's an acceptable form of justice as far as I'm concerned since it's not changing the law it's just bending it so it doesn't create any dangerous precedents (i.e. they would of been charged with what they were charged with regardless but likely wouldn't of gotten anywhere near the max sentence if it wasn't for all this other stuff I'm guessing).
No. Tolokonnikova was one of the founders and leaders, not simply a member. Samutsevich was one of the other members of Voina as you can see from their video and photo reports. As for other two pussy riot members (one of which wasn't caught), it's not clear at all, since neither group has listed their membership for their own safety sake.
Because it's a horrible travesty to the values of the civilized and democratic world, which Russia half-heartedly pretends to be a part of.
I was born in the Soviet Union, and I guess it's clear why the West abandoned us after World War 2.
They're not progressive. They have never fought for anything in their lives. They're a typical US shopper/worker with a cozy priviliged life. In a bubble like that it's difficult to understand.
You're right, but as I said a few times now, it's almost guaranteed that their previous criminal history comes into consideration when a sentence is being handed down hence the 2 years they received.
Fun fact: there's a purposefully funny Russian dub of the Lord of the Rings, and Mordor becomes Mordovia, Gondor becomes Honduras, etc. In Russian it's hilarious.
I'm glad to have more facts, glad to have read the article. But I found it grating that the author emphasized what the facilities used to be used for by a different government. I get the symbolism here. The right way to handle this is to point out the symbolism and then report accurately about the current conditions at these facilities. Propaganda bothers me, even when it's for "my side."
This may be true, but to put bullshit quoted by them in the headline in such a way will make it seem like it's the truth.  Such a line should be in the article, and it should be followed with a debunking, but it shouldn't be the headline, as that will mislead people and the media knows this.
... but it's for their "singing", and not their activism, so it's completely justified.
that raises the question about the legitimacy of the protest, not the power => it's counterproductive

Use sacrificial drone comb - make absolutely sure it's removed while brood still capped
Interesting other issue are bats are coming down with the white nose syndrome (fungus) which is killing them off. They eat insects, and it's entirely possible that not only are we killing insects but in turn we are killing the animals that eat insects, too.
Maybe it's just me but I never really understood why people thought it was a great idea to spray poison all over and why they are surprised when it kills things. I mean, it doesn't take "human poison" to kill me - could be rat poison, could be weed poison, could be bug poison. Likewise with other life forms.
That's not what I meant, I guess I was unclear. What I meant is that it's unsurprising to me that pesticide and herbicide causes massive "collateral damage" to bees, seeing as how pesticide and herbicide at those levels would cause the same damage to most animals.
Sorry, I guess my comment was unclear. What I mean is that since obviously we spend some effort checking crops to make sure that the very small levels of residual pesticide/herbicide do not harm humans, it's utterly unsurprising that much higher levels of pesticide and herbicide harm bees.
Those insects become resistant to that pesticide (or it's found to be too toxic) and they stop it's use, and use something else.  And the cycle repeats.
someone finds a new article, or a new article finds old research.  And every time informed people groan because it's fairly well established as a bunch of causes, and pesticides aren't necessarily even a top one.
This research is important and novel because it's replicating field-level exposures on bumblebee colonies of two pesticides (a neonicitinoid and a pyrethroid) in combination as well as individually, this hasn't been done before.
Heck it's one of the reasons GM foods are so important. Because the current nuke spray effect of pesticides is far more harmful then the controlled levels plants naturally produce, and if we can replicate nature, it'll probably be better for everyone.
I don't think news articles paint the picture right.  There's company involvement all over the place, but most farms, in the states I have lived in, are actually owned and operated by farmers, then they give their crops to a pool/company that distributes.  If a company owns a farm, it's a company started by the family that started the farm.  I have two grandmothers that own a substantial amount of family farms, which act as their retirement income.  The farm is still mostly operated by family members though.
So since Agent Orange is a defoliant it's safe to eat.

According to this interview with Linn, it appears that she bought her first Kindle used,  so it's not entirely inconceivable that it's related to the account tied to the previous owner of that Kindle.
I should add that in addition to emailing, I did call, several times. While it's hard to say if it helped, it was definitely more helpful than emailing.
I only got back a really surley fuck you type message. So then I inquired again politely and got the same shitty response back. Took the gloves off and, without any actual threats, etc mind you, just a bit of a tyraid on how they could treat their customers this way it's not right, etc etc, some tech emails me back saying I'm being threatening and has called the cops on me.
Amazon is now going to release a statement explaining what happened, and it's going to turn out that this woman's Credit Card information has been used in multiple other accounts and Amazon was basically just shutting down all the accounts so that card can't be used anymore on their site.
THAT SAID, how Amazon's handling this is bullshit and they should absolutely be providing her with enough information to know exactly what's going on.  Plus, of course, it's rather troubling to think that your Kindle and everything you purchased for it could be wiped out entirely at the whim of Amazon, with no recourse besides legal action.
Either way, while I'm not saying it's impossible this is 100% an error on Amazon's part, I'm still guessing there's more to the story on the customer's end than we're hearing.
I had a similar problem with Amazon, I think for them it's par for the course to not provide any details why they close an account. I tried calling them a few times - at one time one of the customer reps said that there was no problem with my account, but with an account from a customer in another city who has the same name as I do. (Fine, I have an relatively unusual name, but not that unusual. And really - the credit card details say where I live, so why is that an issue?)
In my experience it's fairly typical for large companies not to provide details in cases which are related to some kind of account fraud or related abuse. The more details they make available, the more vulnerable their detection tech is to gaming by scammers.
It's pretty baffling all around, so don't think I'm defending Amazon TOO much here.  I'm just saying, it's still safe to assume that companies have a purpose to their actions, at least most of the time.
With that said, this post is disturbing.  Regardless of whether she did or didn't do something wrong, or Amazon simply made a mistake, it's not good that we're headed in a direction where large corporations "own" what you "buy" and have the ability to repossess or destroy it with no explanation, no due process and no viable recourse.
I'm sure I've used terms like "purchased" to describe digital media before. I just wanted to use this opportunity to point out the distinction to people who might not otherwise know about it, because it's very relevant to the discussion at hand.
That's probably the most sensible idea. If she lost enough to be worth her time then she should at least contact the amazon legal department and say if it's not sorted out then she will take legal action.
See, the problem is, when I see Amazon could suspend my account by mistake and deny me access to the stuff I bought from them, not tell me why or otherwise try to help fix the mistake, and my only recourse would be to get a lawyer and perhaps go to court, as a potential customer it just doesn't make me want to do business with them. It's too risky and complicated. And it's their loss more than it is mine.
Digital media with restrictions like this should be treated for what they are: rentals. As such, they are only deserving of a rental's price. This is why I never spend more than $10 for a Steam game, or $1-2 for an eBook. If it's not mine, then it's still the seller's, in which case they don't deserve full price for it.
Interestingly enough, only Apple has thus far actually moved to a model embracing technology's strengths without the inane restrictions, but even there it's only with music (and still limited to lossy formats).
This. Also, it's not Amazon deciding on whether an e-book should have DRM or not, it's the publishers. Amazon's actually been fighting a huge legal battle against the publishers, in behalf of their customers to prevent the fucked-up pricing that's been happening (e-books costing as much, and sometimes more than the hard cover version).
The point here isn't who caused the problem, the point here is that Amazon isn't even trying to help this customer fix it. The worst part, for me, is where they stated that "any subsequent account" would be closed as well. What the actual fuck? This is essentially banning the person altogether. I don't think it's wrong to terminate the account of someone who broke the rules, but to keep terminating any new accounts after they've learned a lesson? That's just mean and hostile. And especially so if you refuse to tell the person why you banned them to begin with.
It's shitty, but well within the terms of service, and it's something people should be aware of before they tie so much of their life/purchases to an account that could be closed on a whim.
The problem is when problems occur which the customer service agent in India isn't capable of solving.  This is when you see the beautiful surface of Amazon peel away and what's left is a rotten core of cold heartless automation, the Hades of customer service.  By definition you will get absolutely no assistance here because it's completely devoid of human thought or compassion; again, Amazon is built to ignore the most time consuming customers.  They don't want you, and thus your complaints will be met with mindless form emails until you give up and leave.  Amazon: 1, Annoying Customer: 0.
Believe it or not, I still shop at Amazon because their shopping system is far and away the best.  And if something goes wrong I'm sure I can usually get a decent remedy.  But I have no illusions about the way the company works behind the scenes.  I hope nobody here personally has to deal with Amazon on the same level I did, because it's hell.
No, but it's how many businesses behave as soon as there is the slightest whiff of something that interests the "security" department.
It's usually an issue of some dipshit who loves the power they have to close accounts and goes overboard in assuming somethings bad or fishy when it's not. Once these folks close accounts, it usually took someone higher up like me to MAKE them understand they did a bad thing and open the account back up. Even then, they would smirk and say they weren't wrong. It was absurd.
E: Looks like the Internet killed the blog site. Basically it's someone saying Amazon killed his friend's account and remotely wiped her Kindle because the account was 'related to an existing closed account', and in the following email chain tells her any future accounts will also be closed and refuses to tell her any further details and ends with "we're not going to discuss the matter further" and "thank you for understanding our decision"
Yeah, I mean it's not like they are playing fair. It's a capitalist system, it pays off to be an opportunist, they take advantages of the system and it's fine. But when your avarage Joe does it, it is wrong?
I also don't like this weird digital-age notion content producers have that they can take back what they sold you. If a copy of a file on your computer is considered an "item" (as they insist it is when pirates "publish" millions of copies), and you've bought it, then it's theft for them to take it back. Imagine if publishers (or recording studios, or movie studios) were allowed to walk into your home and box up your books, movies, and DVDs. I would call the goddamn cops on them, and they would go to jail, because that's theft.
She probably violated some form of terms or contract a person does when registering their product. Rarely happens, except they took action. They may not be informing her of her breach do to reason of pursuing other activity related to her account. Although not fair it's my game plan if I was Amazon. Possible she was taking copywritten material and posting that data elsewhere. Uploading to torrents. Honestly a little extreme.

What wouldn't surprise me is hearing something equivalent from Obama. After 3 thankless years of trying to turn around problems he didn't create, while taking all the blame for it, he's still out there campaigning and trying to do the job again. Fucking amazing that he isn't up there going "Hey Romney it's all yours. Good luck, buddy. I'm going to go sit on a beach and watch the world burn."
He's saying the salesman needs to make more money for his family for when he dies. I mean it's either cars or blue meth.
That's because it's been conveniently left out of the media narrative.
Mitt Romney was born in 1947, meaning he would have been 19 in 1966. Age 19 is exactly in the age range where every male member of the LDS church goes on a mission. It's not "convenient", it's just how LDS missions work.
Former Mormon here, not every 19 year old boy goes on a mission, it's a choice. So he clearly chose to do that while avoiding the draft. There were plenty of men that chose the opposite even though they were Mormon 19 year olds.
The problem isn't just in the federal government as an organism, it's in individual government officials that have no integrity.
Unfortunately, there are enough people out there who take religion seriously enough that it's not very pragmatic to mock them in public.  It's not like you have to fall back on his religion to make Romney look ridiculous, anyway.
I think it's more that the title it's without context rather than being misleading. The title just quotes Romney.  I didn't interpret that to mean he running to make money at all (he's a billionaire for chrissake -- who becomes president for the $$?)
They can't fathom that, there are many people who have conservative parents or upbringing, and yet became liberals because /r/politics is not distorting information, it's linking to well-researched news articles by journalists. In the age of the internet, we can check and verify, the truthfulness of /r/politics, and yet these people are flat out saying "LIBERAL MEDIA"; one person in /r/askreddit, got downvoted for saying 'liberal media myth', and people accused him of liberal bias. Anything that doesn't fit their conservative worldview == liberal bias and thus false!
We're calling them "Low information voters" until the middle of November when it's okay to offend them again.
What I can't figure out -- and I've spoken to a number of teachers about it, and no one knows -- is who actually believes this bullshit.  Someone, somewhere, is making policy that no one can fail, that the tests are unfair, that if the material were just taught differently than every child would be smart.  But I don't know who these people are, or why they believe this way.  Hell, I can't even figure out who decided they should stop keeping score in softball; everyone acknowledges that it's bullshit, but that's just the way it's played now.
To be fair, what about all the black voters that came out in 2008 that never voted a day in their life? I do understand that it's a bit different coming from a minority group. On the other hand, I don't feel like the same voters would come out if it was someone like Herman Cain.
the polls are incredibly inaccurate. take this poll for instance, it's the only poll putting Romney ahead.
It's the same brain washing that keeps kids in at night and teaches them to brush their teeth, so let's not take that thought process TOO far.  It comes down to humans being limited in their abilities.  The spectrum is so wide, so vast that anyone wanting to cast a wide political net must first chose to generalized a possibly misleading message, and every political message needs a boogey-man.  When you look at the messages closely it's clear - Democrats blame the republicans, themselves and the past.  The republicans blame anyone but themselves at all costs, and they almost always blame the opponent as a part of their opening line, and then go on to vaguely offer a solution, to be explained and executed AFTER the republican is placed in office.  I'm not saying the democrats are being honest or informed in their description of the placed blame, but I am saying that when a kid comes up to you and blames everyone in the world but himself for the broken lamp, it's pretty clear what happened. Now in this scenario with a broken lamp, a kid with an excuse, and mom the results are clear, but what if this house is full of a LOT of other kids and some adults, but everyone gets equal votes?  That kid with the explanation of what went wrong simply has to speak more loudly and keep his story on track to convince enough OTHER kids that his story is true.  That is the simple method in which the republicans ensure the race will always be close these days, vague up the message to everyone, relying on how busy and uninformed people HAVE to be thanks to the limitations of humans in a drowning economy, and always blame the other guy no matter what.  The only thing that can bring down this type of play is an informed public, and so far we ain't gettin' that.
romnesia at it's finest
yes, it's positively damning...yawn
But it's totally true.  The money is in Washington.  And every President, Senator and Congressmen participates in the corruption.  Even your grand leader ___ (enter name here) is corrupt.  You want real change you need to understand that almost everything you learn in school is a lie to brainwash you into a system of slavery.  Once you know that to be true you can start re-learning the truths of the world and help wake up others.  The only way to change and be free is to educate everyone in what it means to be free.  Religion and Government are here to control you.  These elections mean nothing.  Whoever you vote for will not change things for the better for you, but only change things for the government by consolidation.  The govenment will get bigger and control more and more and make more laws.  And you will still be a worker.  The education system is here to indoctrinate you into thinking you can't survive without being someone's employee - IE: someones slave.  It's never about you being free to live without needing to be an employee.  You don't get taught to own your own land, farm and grow food for yourself.  It's always about you working for someone else, getting paid money to go to the store to buy their crap that you could have grown yourself.   Learn what Serfdom means.  Obama is for big corporations, war, wallstreet, and bailouts for bankers.  Romney is the same.  Make no mistake they are the same.  They want war and money and they don't give a damn about you.  They never did.  Grow up.
Gosh, it's almost like he's a Machiavellian, lying sack of shit.

Even the guy who came up with this argument has apologized and recanted it once he learned how bananas were cultivated to how they are today. So it's doubly stupid to use it. Of course, I'm 90% sure this thing is satire anyway.

Why are there still monkeys - We didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and monkeys have a common ancestor. Asking why are there still monkeys is like asking if you came from your cousin, why are your cousins still here -- it's nonsensical.
What humans have a problem in accepting, is the concept that the universe contains the physics that create time and space; it's impossible for us to really grasp the concept of something from nothing, or nothingness itself because we've never experienced nothing, or anything that has no external form.  *if you die and are nothing, the brain cannot reconcile that notion to anything its ever experienced; how can something like our conscious mind become nothing?  It's far easier to think that we are transformed into something else which allows our conscious mind to carry on to eternity (whatever that actually means).
{...}Grand Canyon form? the force of Colorado river. Ever been there? you should, it's an amazing place.
Isn't it awful how that christian who wrote the thing equates homosexuality and pornography to murder and rape? Those are so unrelated it's not even funny, but obviously to a christian homosexuality or self pleasure is so reprehensible it's up there with violence. I would never equate violence (such as rape and murder) to love (be it hetero, homo, or solo)
I think you have it; it's pretty weak.  Look through the blog.  Seems to be Christian baiting.
Why does my cock fit into my hand so nicely if it's a sin to masturbate?
Grand Canyon form" the force of Colorado river. Ever been there? you should, it's an amazing place.
For what it's worth, I'm a Christian, and I'll give my two cents if anyone would be interested.  (if not, downvote oblivion here i come!)
If we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?  Um.  Well, I don't believe we did come from monkeys, so this is a moot question.  But assuming that I did not believe, according to my understanding of evolution, it's not so much that people came from monkeys, but rather that they shared a similar ancestor.
Yes I have.  I don't know if it's real or not, but to me and what I believe in, it changes nothing.

Someone incredibly familiar with the IEM here. It has nothing to do with corn futures. The reason it isn't regulated is because traders can only invest $500. Anything more than that and the CFTC would consider them a gambling house. Honestly, it is 100% betting on the election, but it's used for research and they don't make a profit, so the CFTC says it's cool.
On top of that, Nate Silver would seem to justify Reddit's bias.
I'm currently reading Nate Silver's book, and it's fascinating to see all of the different factors that must be aggregated to make these predictions.  Very interesting stuff.
The media likes to emphasize the popular vote because it's a lot closer than the electoral vote. If people think Obama has it all sewn up they might stop watching the circus.
This personalization has a really negative effect on how we are informed as citizens. Just by browsing Reddit, you'll passively reinforce particular existing views - and even radicalize them. Without any content to counter or challenge the things we want to see, Reddit essentially becomes an echo chamber. We hear what we already think because the website is personalized to us, and because we hear it again, we think it's right. This effect is vastly compounded if Reddit is your only source of news. Because there is no overarching content control, there is no pressure to supply the other side(s) to issues.
Every time I've posted something that's portrays Obama, Liz Warren, etc in a negative light (which always comes from a good source) it's not only not upvoted, it's actively downvoted by numerous people.
I would love a more neutral subreddit with stricter rules on fact checking and serious comments (no puns, lame jokes and other meaningless posts), because it's almost as bad as /r/athesim in there.
There is also an age component at play here.  Reddit's demographic skews toward liberalism.  It also skews heavily toward those who are just out of college or just starting out in careers, aren't making any money yet and feel powerless.  Those folks, by and large, aren't voting for Romney.
There was an article that went out last week that researched Romney's remark during the debate about the President's pension. Politifact looked into it and found out Obama's pension is set up through the Cayman islands with investments in China. It's also much larger than Romney's. This isn't necessarily the Presidents fault as it's a blind investment setup through Illinois but highly hypocritical of his administration to criticize Romney for the same thing.
I was hoping it would garner some actual discussion (and vitriol) but apparently the post just got largely ignored. I suspect it  would have been on the top of /r/politics for weeks if it was Romney. Honestly I think /r/politics should have it's name changed.
Except the point about American politics being shifted right still stands when you look globally comparing America to other Western nations. The point about a shift to the left does not exist when you look outside the US. Seems like one side has a bit more support for it's case.
Except it's not a point of view, it's a fact. In the "left" / "right" political spectrum the true far left would be your socialism/communism (and don't forget anarcho-syndicalist-communes, lol). In meaningful use of the political spectrum there's no confusion.
I think it's the vote system that fucks everything up. It's meant to be used to vote discussions to the top, but it's used to vote dissenting opinions out of existence. Downvoting things you don't personally agree with is not what the system is in place for, but that's sure as hell how it's used.
Rather, it's just "Their conditions are different.  Case closed.  The end.".
I've noticed the whole Romney-is-evil thing here as well, but what's more troubling to me about political discourse on Reddit is how conservatives as a whole are treated. Reading comments on r/politics, you'd think that there's absolutely no logical basis for a conservative ideology. Sure, I disagree with most of what the GOP currently stands for, but it's possible to agree with the party and be an intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate person. Reading Reddit, you don't get a sense of any of that.
Maybe, but since the start of the month Obama has the lead in 4 polls compared to Romney's 8. Most of these leads on both sides are within the margin of error, but still I'd say it's more likely to go for Romney.
However, polls always have a margin of error, and even that margin of error is not an absolute indicator due to the confidence margin or whatever the statistical term is. I.e. a poll can have a 4 point margin of error but a 1 in 20 chance of being off the mark anyways, I think it's called a p-value, I never actually had a class on it all.
Well, seeing as a ton of the posts from r/politics are just retarded blogs, and at least 50% of the posts are filled with top comments saying "this article is complete bullshit" with intelligent discussion as to why, and then the second or third top comment is "People need to see this and wake up! This country is being destroyed. We aren't free! Romney will destroy us all!" I think it's safe to say that we are incredibly distorted. Not that others aren't, but if you believe Reddit isn't a source with a huge democratic bias, you probably don't value facts that much when it comes to making up your mind about something.  The truth and lies that a news article is composed of is like a smoothie of propaganda, which is which is only distinguishable if you put in the time to check sources, reliability, and how much facts are stretched.
On the other hand it's very comfy to be around people whom you agree with, and it creates a nice, self-perpetuating bubble of smug arrogance (as in my post). It does not mean it's not true, but it can make yourself feel more important than you really are.
I also think there's an element of arrogance involved as well. In the sense that it's unacceptable to admit something as important as an American Election could be so one-sided and predictable. American pop culture is all about drama, drama, drama; and there's no drama in a predictable outcome.

Hi Mr Roberts! First I want to thank you for doing this AMA and also for being so brave and challenging the industry and it's BS console focused mindset. This project is one that I personally had given up on ever seeing and I believe it will have a massive impact on the future of gaming. I am very excited.
And an advice about translating the game in other languages if I may: Please keep the names of the cities, planets and other stuff in the original language. WoW made that mistake and it's really annoying and confusing with all the different names of the cities for example.
Will we be able to build as well as purchase? I don't mean in the RTS sense, but will we be able to establish our own base of operations, in the sense that it's not a ship, but a stationary base?
Also, IIRC, it's been stated that in engagements, 'slots' will be reserved for your friends to jump in and help. Does this mean it won't be a 'come and go as you please' universe or am I just mistaken, which I probably am. Already gonna buy, but this clarification would just get me all the more titalated. Thanks!
Or are you aiming at some other point in the spectrum?  I watched the S42 trailer many, many times, and the speeds and distances involved look similar to WCP, but I know it's very early stage and still a prototype tech demo.  Just wanted to know if the trailer is representative of the combat pacing you're aiming for.
First off, thank you for doing this AMA and the work you’ve done in the past. My questions focus primarily on some of the less space sim-y aspects of Star Citizen. I apologize if these questions have already been asked, it's hard to keep track of all the information. If you could answer just one or two I’d appreciate it.
This game seems ambitious on a scale we haven't seen before.  MMO/single/super detail/super fast/open ended it seems like it's tackling every angle at once.
-I feel like doing the 5$ = __ credits right away is removing the "I've earned this item because of my skills/time spent ingame". Do you think it's ahred amongst player, and if so, how are you going to solve that?
I was wondering if you were planning to implement TrackIR support. You're a PC man and I'm assuming you've heard of the device. I know it's not mega-popular, but it enahances the immersion in games in a way I can't even describe.
Also, how in-depth will customization go in the game? Will it only be "skin deep" with colors and such? I understand that the ships have a large number of modeled parts for realistic damage, but could we be provided with a modular custom ship creator? Say I save up a massive amount of money, could I build a custom Cruiser with a small landing bay in back for one or two fighters? Maybe there would be a buch of prefabricated rooms, engines, features and armament that I could arrange how I wanted and then give it it's armored skin over top to finish construction. Is this idea possible? Not possible? Why?
The original Wing Commander and it's sequels were hugely influential on my life.  I credit my career in IT directly with the skills and lessons I learned while learning how to make these games run properly on various computers over the years.
I just want to say, you are amazing!!! I am still playing freelancer (discovery mod) since its really the only space sim that gets it right. It has held up amazingly well for being such an old game, and I'm so excited for the improvements you're bringing to Star Citizen. As an engineer, the fly by wire system has me really excited! I absolutely cannot wait to play this game, and I'm even considering buying a dedicated gaming rig just to play it in all it's glory!

You forgot to put words over it. Reddit won't upvote comments like this unless it's a gif or reiterates the message on the picture.
"This guy is right, for once it's not a video or story about a girl being shot or raped, good on us, for once."
As it seems like none of my previous classmates are redditors I feel it's my duty to defend my school against some of the less constructive comments.
This is Witney M. Young high school and it's a magnet school in Chicago. Top 3 in the city, 4th in the state, and around 135 in the nation. It's pretty funny reading a bunch of comments about this "inner city" school, when in fact the majority of the students in that video are probably enrolled in AP classes and will receive offers of enrollment from some of the top universities in the country.
To be fair, it's not really reddit logic. It's the American middle-class suburb logic.
Haha thank you. Although I do provide some evidence in some of my replies to back up the claim that this school is supposed to be good. But I don't see how it's not believable that a video of kids being kids (not really kids) can come from a school with high test scores. No matter where you are, at the ages of 14–18 you're going to do ridiculous things and be rowdy. In fact, you probably know that in these schools no one really causes trouble, so that's why the teachers don't shut it down right away because they know it probably won't get too out of control despite how loud it is. I'm guessing within a minute after the video stopped, some high up faculty walks by, tells them to quiet down, and everyone goes back to being normal.
Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
What makes you think it's from the inner city?
If you serve someone back after getting served, then it's on.
Wait... so high school today really IS like it's portrayed in those stupid dance movies?
Just wait until you see their football games. It's not about football at all, it's just an opportunity for each school's marching band to compete with each other.
Oh it's on.
Oh...it's on!
but now it's on....

This is an MRI scan, so it's a cross sectional image.
Exactly. There's no doubt that one is bigger than the other but as far as comparisons go, you can't go in too much details since it's not the same cut.
Correct me if I'm wrong [edit: I am wrong, see /u/Mansy's comment below], but I don't think this isn't an MRI scan. I think it's images taken in a method akin to the Visible Human Project - literally images of frozen cadavers which are photographed cross-sectionally, then a layer is removed (destructively), a new photo taken and so on and so forth.
it's hard to see the plane in which these are taken, but I think those are eyes.
Being fat is unhealthy, same as smoking. We should ultimately respect people's decisions, but I don't see how it's unreasonable to suggest that overweight people lose some weight.
So it's farts.
Jesus the human heart is huge, it's weirding me out man
yeah, I once saw a scan of my chest and all I though was "damn, what the hell is this thing? it's freakin huge!" ... "oh, that's the heart?? :o"
it's all good, You left it on, but you also left the side door open, so I walked in and turned it off.
No, it's more than just that. Look at the muscle development on the interior side of the ankles, and the shape of the ankles themselves. Her disorders are related to more than just being overweight, although i'm sure it's adding additional strain and not improving her situation.
I know jack about MRIs but I'm guessing it's only because of how the MRI take's a 'slice'. It's probably the same reason why the arm bones aren't visible on each women, since they would be angled downwards while laying on a table
It is not healthy that fat people have larger hearts. It's the body's way of adapting to needing to supply more blood. When the heart does this, it is prone to heart-attacks and cardiovascular diseases. Being obese puts tremendous strain on the heart, so no, it's not healthy.
See, it's not bullying.
Yes, it's visceral fat (fat that surrounds the organs). It's very unhealthy to have a significant amount of visceral fat because your body faces a huge risk in heart problems, diabetes and various other health issues.
If it's a CT scan, dark areas are less dense.  You can usually tell if a person has gas by a black area in the stomach.  (disclaimer: I am not a radiologist).  If dark area was shit, then this person inhaled a ton of it into her lungs.
If it's a CT scan ... I suck at reading MRI's though.
No, it's just air. Unfortunately, you won't be able to say "Fat girls are full of shit, I've seen it!"
yeah, i have the same problem getting through doorways as well. not because i'm so large (since i'm 1% bodyfat) but because my dick is 36 inches long and always erect. it's very hard traversing through tight knit indoor environments and sharp turns when you have that much sway and inertia in your lower body.

Gaga has a pretty great voice, it's just not as unique as Adele's-
I think the music biz really is like this. Some guy thought that the "lady gaga" marketing campaign is what was needed. Was it? Would more people have liked her original image? No one can truly say. I think that the perception of the gatekeeper has much more to do with what is inflicted upon us than the reality of what people really like. I mean, it's not as if Adele needed to be marketed as Princess Delly or something with backup dancers in tow.
Yeah, except the whole child prodigy thing. I'm not a fan of her or her music but she apparently has some serious chops. Also pop music is meant to be superficial and vapid. Consequently it's also designed to make a lot of money as well. During every part of modern music there are people that hear whatever is popular and decry how it's leading to the decay of society. It's just not true. Jazz and Rock n' Roll were supposed to lead to the doom of the world, but that never happened. Basically you just shouldn't make sweeping generalizations like that based on the like 2 songs you heard from her.
As a competent guitar player, I'm at the point where I don't like certain players because of the knowledge that being a musician imparts to me. For me one of these players is Slash. As a rock band, G'n'R is pretty great, but I can't just listen to them without analyzing Slash's playing. It sounds good, but it's not great in the guitar realm. When my relatives found out I was a guitar player they all seemed to jump on the "play me Sweet Child" bandwagon but when I explained that I didn't know it because I didn't like Slash, their response was akin to "shut up, he's famous and you're not, so he's done something right."
Meanwhile I was studying SRV, BB King, Townshend, and Hendrix who are arguably more important to rock than Slash. Can you see the disconnect here? It's not even a matter of talent unless the "victim" (for lack of a better word) is going around saying how much better they are than x or y; it's usually a matter of taste.
Let's be honest...lyrically and musically speaking it's all been done before and pretty much half the insane bullshit she does was done by Madonna before her.
oh hey look it's a normal hot person
Oh ok so because you like Bowies music more, so it's ok for him to act weird
the reason she became famous was because of her standing out. She HAD to stand out against the competition, otherwise no one would hear her, she was just another "aspiring" musician. Now, she's a somebody. She has a name. She can be normal if she wants to, but I think she enjoys being OTT, she knows it's working, she makes the headlines with every new outfit she comes up with. Plus, it must be fantastic to be a celebrity and have NO ONE recodnise you out of your "image" :)

I definitely understand where you're coming from and I appreciate the sentiment. I just feel sad when I look at myself and don't see what I would like. I've gotten over any embarrassment with regards to what others think. I'd really like to just be happy with what I have, and most of the time it's not on my mind at all, but if I'm being honest I'd love to fill in shirts and dresses better, not bust out of them, but just fit properly so they aren't hanging off of me. I hate clothes shopping and that's a big part of why, nothing is really designed for flat girls. Not in my income range anyway.
it's ok. small chested girls make me have a sad too.
It's probably because for her, it's about what she likes, not about what you do.
I don't think it's what she likes.  I think it's what she thinks that the world likes.
That's not a good thing. It's like saying, "Your breasts are so small, it's just like you had breast cancer and got them removed!"
Next time my girlfriend complains about her boobs I'll let her know that it's OK, at least she can wear suspenders.
Not that it's really the same thing but that's like telling a fat person "don't worry there's a ton of people who have fat fetishes!"
Obviously having small boobs is commonly more preferred than being fat but it's still not a super conforming sentiment.
Yeah, the way I see it.......okay, it's nice that you and others like small boobs, that people find them attractive. But I don't. And I'm the one who has to live with 'em.
Definitely still need a sports bra - though you're right that it's probably no where near as uncomfortable. They still bounce a little bit.
Not that I play golf but I've heard that it's also easier with small breasts.

It's not really that we have a monopoly on Reddit's advertising system, it's just that there are not a lot of advertisers on Reddit in general. We actually pay the minimum amount required per day to advertise ($30 per subreddit), and are usually competing with a few different ads each day. Redditors love the site, the 5K+ upvotes and comments are all legit (as krispykrackers confirmed above), and this ad brings us a ton of new visitors, so it's worthwhile for us to keep this ad running every day.
It's because it's the same thread being promoted, those are the same comments you see everytime.

Hahaha I think it was a bigger problem when the comics code authority cracked down on them. They had to create villains that weren't overtly threatening. Now it's the opposite, everyone's trying to out-grit and out-brutalize each other.
"Apelsin - Kolsyrad läskedryck" Basically means that it's orange flavored carbonated soda.
Not that anyone would likely crack it open and drink it... but if it's been in storage for roughly as long as it is old without severe agitation, all the syrup and additives have come out of suspension... the top part is all carbonated water, and the lower part is all syrup and coloring.
I cracked a Pepsi from dad's cupboard and realized that the soda was bland-- thought, "oh... it's just caffeine free... and flavor free."  So I poured it in the sink and it came out clear followed by brown sludge.
There is a protective liner along the inside of the can, protecting the metal from the liquid, however it is easily punctured, particularly if the can has ever been dented (either by you or somewhere along the process shipping from the factory to the store). Once that happens, it's not a question of if but when it will begin to leak everywhere and destroy everything you hold dear.

Your park rating will drop, but it's oh so fun.
It was one of those deals where they released almost the exact same game but with a few minor changes and called it '2'. There are new rides and things, it's more or less an expansion park.
The only really notable difference is that you could stack scenery. In the first one you could only build little walls on the grass, but once you are able to stack scenery, you can work upward too, so it allowed you to build little houses and things, with roofs and that. This made little difference to the game, but once the modding community got hold of it, they made their own scenery, and used this new stacking ability to make incredibly complex structures and things. Just take a look at the links I provided, it's amazing, but still so time consuming; each piece on each square is placed by hand.
But you're forgetting it's called Universe Sandbox.
check out GOG...they sometimes have sales too and it's DRM free

That's what reddit's for.
Actually, it's >7 billion now.
Every 150 minutes there is 1 year of video uploaded, that is INCREDIBLE. My mind is blown just trying to comprehend consuming that much content and it's uploaded EVERY 150 minutes!
Reddit isn't useful to me because it's a link aggregator or a forum. It's useful because it's a scalable and universal system for screening content, from videos to products to music or fashion. Google has spent the last few years trying to tackle "social search." Reddit ended up doing by accident.
With inflation it's more like over 9.86 based on this huffpost article.
The problem that drives reposts isn't a lack of content - it's a lack of good content, and good ways to separate the good from the bad. The reason we get reposts is that they've already gotten past the "is this good or bad?" filter, and so can be depended on. If good content is a needle in a stack of shit, then reposts are all those needles that have been painstakingly grabbed from the shit and already set aside.
If you filter out videos of cats and crap lets plays, it's about 30 minutes.
This is strongly in line with the lifestyle of it's founder and CEO, Tristam Shandy.

Ya know sometimes, as a parent, it's just better to let your kid not eat their peas and green beans if they don't want to.
Because parents are supposed to be proud when their children kill or die for their country, not when they speak up when it's illegal or may offend people.
the speaking up I can deal with it's their right as humans to do so, the breaking and entering, destruction of property and assault I cannot.
It's an acceptable form of justice as far as I'm concerned since it's not changing the law it's just bending it so it doesn't create any dangerous precedents (i.e. they would of been charged with what they were charged with regardless but likely wouldn't of gotten anywhere near the max sentence if it wasn't for all this other stuff I'm guessing).
No. Tolokonnikova was one of the founders and leaders, not simply a member. Samutsevich was one of the other members of Voina as you can see from their video and photo reports. As for other two pussy riot members (one of which wasn't caught), it's not clear at all, since neither group has listed their membership for their own safety sake.
Because it's a horrible travesty to the values of the civilized and democratic world, which Russia half-heartedly pretends to be a part of.
I was born in the Soviet Union, and I guess it's clear why the West abandoned us after World War 2.
They're not progressive. They have never fought for anything in their lives. They're a typical US shopper/worker with a cozy priviliged life. In a bubble like that it's difficult to understand.
You're right, but as I said a few times now, it's almost guaranteed that their previous criminal history comes into consideration when a sentence is being handed down hence the 2 years they received.
Fun fact: there's a purposefully funny Russian dub of the Lord of the Rings, and Mordor becomes Mordovia, Gondor becomes Honduras, etc. In Russian it's hilarious.
I'm glad to have more facts, glad to have read the article. But I found it grating that the author emphasized what the facilities used to be used for by a different government. I get the symbolism here. The right way to handle this is to point out the symbolism and then report accurately about the current conditions at these facilities. Propaganda bothers me, even when it's for "my side."
This may be true, but to put bullshit quoted by them in the headline in such a way will make it seem like it's the truth.  Such a line should be in the article, and it should be followed with a debunking, but it shouldn't be the headline, as that will mislead people and the media knows this.
... but it's for their "singing", and not their activism, so it's completely justified.
that raises the question about the legitimacy of the protest, not the power => it's counterproductive

Use sacrificial drone comb - make absolutely sure it's removed while brood still capped
Interesting other issue are bats are coming down with the white nose syndrome (fungus) which is killing them off. They eat insects, and it's entirely possible that not only are we killing insects but in turn we are killing the animals that eat insects, too.
Maybe it's just me but I never really understood why people thought it was a great idea to spray poison all over and why they are surprised when it kills things. I mean, it doesn't take "human poison" to kill me - could be rat poison, could be weed poison, could be bug poison. Likewise with other life forms.
That's not what I meant, I guess I was unclear. What I meant is that it's unsurprising to me that pesticide and herbicide causes massive "collateral damage" to bees, seeing as how pesticide and herbicide at those levels would cause the same damage to most animals.
Sorry, I guess my comment was unclear. What I mean is that since obviously we spend some effort checking crops to make sure that the very small levels of residual pesticide/herbicide do not harm humans, it's utterly unsurprising that much higher levels of pesticide and herbicide harm bees.
Those insects become resistant to that pesticide (or it's found to be too toxic) and they stop it's use, and use something else.  And the cycle repeats.
someone finds a new article, or a new article finds old research.  And every time informed people groan because it's fairly well established as a bunch of causes, and pesticides aren't necessarily even a top one.
This research is important and novel because it's replicating field-level exposures on bumblebee colonies of two pesticides (a neonicitinoid and a pyrethroid) in combination as well as individually, this hasn't been done before.
Heck it's one of the reasons GM foods are so important. Because the current nuke spray effect of pesticides is far more harmful then the controlled levels plants naturally produce, and if we can replicate nature, it'll probably be better for everyone.
I don't think news articles paint the picture right.  There's company involvement all over the place, but most farms, in the states I have lived in, are actually owned and operated by farmers, then they give their crops to a pool/company that distributes.  If a company owns a farm, it's a company started by the family that started the farm.  I have two grandmothers that own a substantial amount of family farms, which act as their retirement income.  The farm is still mostly operated by family members though.
So since Agent Orange is a defoliant it's safe to eat.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11vz4g/amazon_closes_womans_account_and_wipes_her_kindle/
According to this interview with Linn, it appears that she bought her first Kindle used,  so it's not entirely inconceivable that it's related to the account tied to the previous owner of that Kindle.
I should add that in addition to emailing, I did call, several times. While it's hard to say if it helped, it was definitely more helpful than emailing.
I only got back a really surley fuck you type message. So then I inquired again politely and got the same shitty response back. Took the gloves off and, without any actual threats, etc mind you, just a bit of a tyraid on how they could treat their customers this way it's not right, etc etc, some tech emails me back saying I'm being threatening and has called the cops on me.
Amazon is now going to release a statement explaining what happened, and it's going to turn out that this woman's Credit Card information has been used in multiple other accounts and Amazon was basically just shutting down all the accounts so that card can't be used anymore on their site.
THAT SAID, how Amazon's handling this is bullshit and they should absolutely be providing her with enough information to know exactly what's going on.  Plus, of course, it's rather troubling to think that your Kindle and everything you purchased for it could be wiped out entirely at the whim of Amazon, with no recourse besides legal action.
Either way, while I'm not saying it's impossible this is 100% an error on Amazon's part, I'm still guessing there's more to the story on the customer's end than we're hearing.
I had a similar problem with Amazon, I think for them it's par for the course to not provide any details why they close an account. I tried calling them a few times - at one time one of the customer reps said that there was no problem with my account, but with an account from a customer in another city who has the same name as I do. (Fine, I have an relatively unusual name, but not that unusual. And really - the credit card details say where I live, so why is that an issue?)
In my experience it's fairly typical for large companies not to provide details in cases which are related to some kind of account fraud or related abuse. The more details they make available, the more vulnerable their detection tech is to gaming by scammers.
It's pretty baffling all around, so don't think I'm defending Amazon TOO much here.  I'm just saying, it's still safe to assume that companies have a purpose to their actions, at least most of the time.
With that said, this post is disturbing.  Regardless of whether she did or didn't do something wrong, or Amazon simply made a mistake, it's not good that we're headed in a direction where large corporations "own" what you "buy" and have the ability to repossess or destroy it with no explanation, no due process and no viable recourse.
I'm sure I've used terms like "purchased" to describe digital media before. I just wanted to use this opportunity to point out the distinction to people who might not otherwise know about it, because it's very relevant to the discussion at hand.
That's probably the most sensible idea. If she lost enough to be worth her time then she should at least contact the amazon legal department and say if it's not sorted out then she will take legal action.
See, the problem is, when I see Amazon could suspend my account by mistake and deny me access to the stuff I bought from them, not tell me why or otherwise try to help fix the mistake, and my only recourse would be to get a lawyer and perhaps go to court, as a potential customer it just doesn't make me want to do business with them. It's too risky and complicated. And it's their loss more than it is mine.
Digital media with restrictions like this should be treated for what they are: rentals. As such, they are only deserving of a rental's price. This is why I never spend more than $10 for a Steam game, or $1-2 for an eBook. If it's not mine, then it's still the seller's, in which case they don't deserve full price for it.
Interestingly enough, only Apple has thus far actually moved to a model embracing technology's strengths without the inane restrictions, but even there it's only with music (and still limited to lossy formats).
This. Also, it's not Amazon deciding on whether an e-book should have DRM or not, it's the publishers. Amazon's actually been fighting a huge legal battle against the publishers, in behalf of their customers to prevent the fucked-up pricing that's been happening (e-books costing as much, and sometimes more than the hard cover version).
The point here isn't who caused the problem, the point here is that Amazon isn't even trying to help this customer fix it. The worst part, for me, is where they stated that "any subsequent account" would be closed as well. What the actual fuck? This is essentially banning the person altogether. I don't think it's wrong to terminate the account of someone who broke the rules, but to keep terminating any new accounts after they've learned a lesson? That's just mean and hostile. And especially so if you refuse to tell the person why you banned them to begin with.
It's shitty, but well within the terms of service, and it's something people should be aware of before they tie so much of their life/purchases to an account that could be closed on a whim.
The problem is when problems occur which the customer service agent in India isn't capable of solving.  This is when you see the beautiful surface of Amazon peel away and what's left is a rotten core of cold heartless automation, the Hades of customer service.  By definition you will get absolutely no assistance here because it's completely devoid of human thought or compassion; again, Amazon is built to ignore the most time consuming customers.  They don't want you, and thus your complaints will be met with mindless form emails until you give up and leave.  Amazon: 1, Annoying Customer: 0.
Believe it or not, I still shop at Amazon because their shopping system is far and away the best.  And if something goes wrong I'm sure I can usually get a decent remedy.  But I have no illusions about the way the company works behind the scenes.  I hope nobody here personally has to deal with Amazon on the same level I did, because it's hell.
No, but it's how many businesses behave as soon as there is the slightest whiff of something that interests the "security" department.
It's usually an issue of some dipshit who loves the power they have to close accounts and goes overboard in assuming somethings bad or fishy when it's not. Once these folks close accounts, it usually took someone higher up like me to MAKE them understand they did a bad thing and open the account back up. Even then, they would smirk and say they weren't wrong. It was absurd.
E: Looks like the Internet killed the blog site. Basically it's someone saying Amazon killed his friend's account and remotely wiped her Kindle because the account was 'related to an existing closed account', and in the following email chain tells her any future accounts will also be closed and refuses to tell her any further details and ends with "we're not going to discuss the matter further" and "thank you for understanding our decision"
Yeah, I mean it's not like they are playing fair. It's a capitalist system, it pays off to be an opportunist, they take advantages of the system and it's fine. But when your avarage Joe does it, it is wrong?
I also don't like this weird digital-age notion content producers have that they can take back what they sold you. If a copy of a file on your computer is considered an "item" (as they insist it is when pirates "publish" millions of copies), and you've bought it, then it's theft for them to take it back. Imagine if publishers (or recording studios, or movie studios) were allowed to walk into your home and box up your books, movies, and DVDs. I would call the goddamn cops on them, and they would go to jail, because that's theft.
She probably violated some form of terms or contract a person does when registering their product. Rarely happens, except they took action. They may not be informing her of her breach do to reason of pursuing other activity related to her account. Although not fair it's my game plan if I was Amazon. Possible she was taking copywritten material and posting that data elsewhere. Uploading to torrents. Honestly a little extreme.

What wouldn't surprise me is hearing something equivalent from Obama. After 3 thankless years of trying to turn around problems he didn't create, while taking all the blame for it, he's still out there campaigning and trying to do the job again. Fucking amazing that he isn't up there going "Hey Romney it's all yours. Good luck, buddy. I'm going to go sit on a beach and watch the world burn."
He's saying the salesman needs to make more money for his family for when he dies. I mean it's either cars or blue meth.
That's because it's been conveniently left out of the media narrative.
Mitt Romney was born in 1947, meaning he would have been 19 in 1966. Age 19 is exactly in the age range where every male member of the LDS church goes on a mission. It's not "convenient", it's just how LDS missions work.
Former Mormon here, not every 19 year old boy goes on a mission, it's a choice. So he clearly chose to do that while avoiding the draft. There were plenty of men that chose the opposite even though they were Mormon 19 year olds.
The problem isn't just in the federal government as an organism, it's in individual government officials that have no integrity.
Unfortunately, there are enough people out there who take religion seriously enough that it's not very pragmatic to mock them in public.  It's not like you have to fall back on his religion to make Romney look ridiculous, anyway.
I think it's more that the title it's without context rather than being misleading. The title just quotes Romney.  I didn't interpret that to mean he running to make money at all (he's a billionaire for chrissake -- who becomes president for the $$?)
They can't fathom that, there are many people who have conservative parents or upbringing, and yet became liberals because /r/politics is not distorting information, it's linking to well-researched news articles by journalists. In the age of the internet, we can check and verify, the truthfulness of /r/politics, and yet these people are flat out saying "LIBERAL MEDIA"; one person in /r/askreddit, got downvoted for saying 'liberal media myth', and people accused him of liberal bias. Anything that doesn't fit their conservative worldview == liberal bias and thus false!
We're calling them "Low information voters" until the middle of November when it's okay to offend them again.
What I can't figure out -- and I've spoken to a number of teachers about it, and no one knows -- is who actually believes this bullshit.  Someone, somewhere, is making policy that no one can fail, that the tests are unfair, that if the material were just taught differently than every child would be smart.  But I don't know who these people are, or why they believe this way.  Hell, I can't even figure out who decided they should stop keeping score in softball; everyone acknowledges that it's bullshit, but that's just the way it's played now.
To be fair, what about all the black voters that came out in 2008 that never voted a day in their life? I do understand that it's a bit different coming from a minority group. On the other hand, I don't feel like the same voters would come out if it was someone like Herman Cain.
the polls are incredibly inaccurate. take this poll for instance, it's the only poll putting Romney ahead.
It's the same brain washing that keeps kids in at night and teaches them to brush their teeth, so let's not take that thought process TOO far.  It comes down to humans being limited in their abilities.  The spectrum is so wide, so vast that anyone wanting to cast a wide political net must first chose to generalized a possibly misleading message, and every political message needs a boogey-man.  When you look at the messages closely it's clear - Democrats blame the republicans, themselves and the past.  The republicans blame anyone but themselves at all costs, and they almost always blame the opponent as a part of their opening line, and then go on to vaguely offer a solution, to be explained and executed AFTER the republican is placed in office.  I'm not saying the democrats are being honest or informed in their description of the placed blame, but I am saying that when a kid comes up to you and blames everyone in the world but himself for the broken lamp, it's pretty clear what happened. Now in this scenario with a broken lamp, a kid with an excuse, and mom the results are clear, but what if this house is full of a LOT of other kids and some adults, but everyone gets equal votes?  That kid with the explanation of what went wrong simply has to speak more loudly and keep his story on track to convince enough OTHER kids that his story is true.  That is the simple method in which the republicans ensure the race will always be close these days, vague up the message to everyone, relying on how busy and uninformed people HAVE to be thanks to the limitations of humans in a drowning economy, and always blame the other guy no matter what.  The only thing that can bring down this type of play is an informed public, and so far we ain't gettin' that.

But it's totally true.  The money is in Washington.  And every President, Senator and Congressmen participates in the corruption.  Even your grand leader ___ (enter name here) is corrupt.  You want real change you need to understand that almost everything you learn in school is a lie to brainwash you into a system of slavery.  Once you know that to be true you can start re-learning the truths of the world and help wake up others.  The only way to change and be free is to educate everyone in what it means to be free.  Religion and Government are here to control you.  These elections mean nothing.  Whoever you vote for will not change things for the better for you, but only change things for the government by consolidation.  The govenment will get bigger and control more and more and make more laws.  And you will still be a worker.  The education system is here to indoctrinate you into thinking you can't survive without being someone's employee - IE: someones slave.  It's never about you being free to live without needing to be an employee.  You don't get taught to own your own land, farm and grow food for yourself.  It's always about you working for someone else, getting paid money to go to the store to buy their crap that you could have grown yourself.   Learn what Serfdom means.  Obama is for big corporations, war, wallstreet, and bailouts for bankers.  Romney is the same.  Make no mistake they are the same.  They want war and money and they don't give a damn about you.  They never did.  Grow up.
Gosh, it's almost like he's a Machiavellian, lying sack of shit.

Why are there still monkeys - We didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and monkeys have a common ancestor. Asking why are there still monkeys is like asking if you came from your cousin, why are your cousins still here -- it's nonsensical.
What humans have a problem in accepting, is the concept that the universe contains the physics that create time and space; it's impossible for us to really grasp the concept of something from nothing, or nothingness itself because we've never experienced nothing, or anything that has no external form.  *if you die and are nothing, the brain cannot reconcile that notion to anything its ever experienced; how can something like our conscious mind become nothing?  It's far easier to think that we are transformed into something else which allows our conscious mind to carry on to eternity (whatever that actually means).
{...}Grand Canyon form? the force of Colorado river. Ever been there? you should, it's an amazing place.
Isn't it awful how that christian who wrote the thing equates homosexuality and pornography to murder and rape? Those are so unrelated it's not even funny, but obviously to a christian homosexuality or self pleasure is so reprehensible it's up there with violence. I would never equate violence (such as rape and murder) to love (be it hetero, homo, or solo)
I think you have it; it's pretty weak.  Look through the blog.  Seems to be Christian baiting.
Why does my cock fit into my hand so nicely if it's a sin to masturbate?

For what it's worth, I'm a Christian, and I'll give my two cents if anyone would be interested.  (if not, downvote oblivion here i come!)
If we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?  Um.  Well, I don't believe we did come from monkeys, so this is a moot question.  But assuming that I did not believe, according to my understanding of evolution, it's not so much that people came from monkeys, but rather that they shared a similar ancestor.
Yes I have.  I don't know if it's real or not, but to me and what I believe in, it changes nothing.

Someone incredibly familiar with the IEM here. It has nothing to do with corn futures. The reason it isn't regulated is because traders can only invest $500. Anything more than that and the CFTC would consider them a gambling house. Honestly, it is 100% betting on the election, but it's used for research and they don't make a profit, so the CFTC says it's cool.
On top of that, Nate Silver would seem to justify Reddit's bias.
I'm currently reading Nate Silver's book, and it's fascinating to see all of the different factors that must be aggregated to make these predictions.  Very interesting stuff.
The media likes to emphasize the popular vote because it's a lot closer than the electoral vote. If people think Obama has it all sewn up they might stop watching the circus.
This personalization has a really negative effect on how we are informed as citizens. Just by browsing Reddit, you'll passively reinforce particular existing views - and even radicalize them. Without any content to counter or challenge the things we want to see, Reddit essentially becomes an echo chamber. We hear what we already think because the website is personalized to us, and because we hear it again, we think it's right. This effect is vastly compounded if Reddit is your only source of news. Because there is no overarching content control, there is no pressure to supply the other side(s) to issues.
Every time I've posted something that's portrays Obama, Liz Warren, etc in a negative light (which always comes from a good source) it's not only not upvoted, it's actively downvoted by numerous people.
I would love a more neutral subreddit with stricter rules on fact checking and serious comments (no puns, lame jokes and other meaningless posts), because it's almost as bad as /r/athesim in there.
There is also an age component at play here.  Reddit's demographic skews toward liberalism.  It also skews heavily toward those who are just out of college or just starting out in careers, aren't making any money yet and feel powerless.  Those folks, by and large, aren't voting for Romney.
There was an article that went out last week that researched Romney's remark during the debate about the President's pension. Politifact looked into it and found out Obama's pension is set up through the Cayman islands with investments in China. It's also much larger than Romney's. This isn't necessarily the Presidents fault as it's a blind investment setup through Illinois but highly hypocritical of his administration to criticize Romney for the same thing.
I was hoping it would garner some actual discussion (and vitriol) but apparently the post just got largely ignored. I suspect it  would have been on the top of /r/politics for weeks if it was Romney. Honestly I think /r/politics should have it's name changed.
Except the point about American politics being shifted right still stands when you look globally comparing America to other Western nations. The point about a shift to the left does not exist when you look outside the US. Seems like one side has a bit more support for it's case.
Except it's not a point of view, it's a fact. In the "left" / "right" political spectrum the true far left would be your socialism/communism (and don't forget anarcho-syndicalist-communes, lol). In meaningful use of the political spectrum there's no confusion.
I think it's the vote system that fucks everything up. It's meant to be used to vote discussions to the top, but it's used to vote dissenting opinions out of existence. Downvoting things you don't personally agree with is not what the system is in place for, but that's sure as hell how it's used.
Rather, it's just "Their conditions are different.  Case closed.  The end.".
I've noticed the whole Romney-is-evil thing here as well, but what's more troubling to me about political discourse on Reddit is how conservatives as a whole are treated. Reading comments on r/politics, you'd think that there's absolutely no logical basis for a conservative ideology. Sure, I disagree with most of what the GOP currently stands for, but it's possible to agree with the party and be an intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate person. Reading Reddit, you don't get a sense of any of that.
Maybe, but since the start of the month Obama has the lead in 4 polls compared to Romney's 8. Most of these leads on both sides are within the margin of error, but still I'd say it's more likely to go for Romney.
However, polls always have a margin of error, and even that margin of error is not an absolute indicator due to the confidence margin or whatever the statistical term is. I.e. a poll can have a 4 point margin of error but a 1 in 20 chance of being off the mark anyways, I think it's called a p-value, I never actually had a class on it all.
Well, seeing as a ton of the posts from r/politics are just retarded blogs, and at least 50% of the posts are filled with top comments saying "this article is complete bullshit" with intelligent discussion as to why, and then the second or third top comment is "People need to see this and wake up! This country is being destroyed. We aren't free! Romney will destroy us all!" I think it's safe to say that we are incredibly distorted. Not that others aren't, but if you believe Reddit isn't a source with a huge democratic bias, you probably don't value facts that much when it comes to making up your mind about something.  The truth and lies that a news article is composed of is like a smoothie of propaganda, which is which is only distinguishable if you put in the time to check sources, reliability, and how much facts are stretched.
On the other hand it's very comfy to be around people whom you agree with, and it creates a nice, self-perpetuating bubble of smug arrogance (as in my post). It does not mean it's not true, but it can make yourself feel more important than you really are.
I also think there's an element of arrogance involved as well. In the sense that it's unacceptable to admit something as important as an American Election could be so one-sided and predictable. American pop culture is all about drama, drama, drama; and there's no drama in a predictable outcome.

Hi Mr Roberts! First I want to thank you for doing this AMA and also for being so brave and challenging the industry and it's BS console focused mindset. This project is one that I personally had given up on ever seeing and I believe it will have a massive impact on the future of gaming. I am very excited.
And an advice about translating the game in other languages if I may: Please keep the names of the cities, planets and other stuff in the original language. WoW made that mistake and it's really annoying and confusing with all the different names of the cities for example.
Will we be able to build as well as purchase? I don't mean in the RTS sense, but will we be able to establish our own base of operations, in the sense that it's not a ship, but a stationary base?
Also, IIRC, it's been stated that in engagements, 'slots' will be reserved for your friends to jump in and help. Does this mean it won't be a 'come and go as you please' universe or am I just mistaken, which I probably am. Already gonna buy, but this clarification would just get me all the more titalated. Thanks!
Or are you aiming at some other point in the spectrum?  I watched the S42 trailer many, many times, and the speeds and distances involved look similar to WCP, but I know it's very early stage and still a prototype tech demo.  Just wanted to know if the trailer is representative of the combat pacing you're aiming for.
First off, thank you for doing this AMA and the work you’ve done in the past. My questions focus primarily on some of the less space sim-y aspects of Star Citizen. I apologize if these questions have already been asked, it's hard to keep track of all the information. If you could answer just one or two I’d appreciate it.
This game seems ambitious on a scale we haven't seen before.  MMO/single/super detail/super fast/open ended it seems like it's tackling every angle at once.
-I feel like doing the 5$ = __ credits right away is removing the "I've earned this item because of my skills/time spent ingame". Do you think it's ahred amongst player, and if so, how are you going to solve that?
I was wondering if you were planning to implement TrackIR support. You're a PC man and I'm assuming you've heard of the device. I know it's not mega-popular, but it enahances the immersion in games in a way I can't even describe.
Also, how in-depth will customization go in the game? Will it only be "skin deep" with colors and such? I understand that the ships have a large number of modeled parts for realistic damage, but could we be provided with a modular custom ship creator? Say I save up a massive amount of money, could I build a custom Cruiser with a small landing bay in back for one or two fighters? Maybe there would be a buch of prefabricated rooms, engines, features and armament that I could arrange how I wanted and then give it it's armored skin over top to finish construction. Is this idea possible? Not possible? Why?
The original Wing Commander and it's sequels were hugely influential on my life.  I credit my career in IT directly with the skills and lessons I learned while learning how to make these games run properly on various computers over the years.
I just want to say, you are amazing!!! I am still playing freelancer (discovery mod) since its really the only space sim that gets it right. It has held up amazingly well for being such an old game, and I'm so excited for the improvements you're bringing to Star Citizen. As an engineer, the fly by wire system has me really excited! I absolutely cannot wait to play this game, and I'm even considering buying a dedicated gaming rig just to play it in all it's glory!

You forgot to put words over it. Reddit won't upvote comments like this unless it's a gif or reiterates the message on the picture.
"This guy is right, for once it's not a video or story about a girl being shot or raped, good on us, for once."
As it seems like none of my previous classmates are redditors I feel it's my duty to defend my school against some of the less constructive comments.
This is Witney M. Young high school and it's a magnet school in Chicago. Top 3 in the city, 4th in the state, and around 135 in the nation. It's pretty funny reading a bunch of comments about this "inner city" school, when in fact the majority of the students in that video are probably enrolled in AP classes and will receive offers of enrollment from some of the top universities in the country.
To be fair, it's not really reddit logic. It's the American middle-class suburb logic.
Haha thank you. Although I do provide some evidence in some of my replies to back up the claim that this school is supposed to be good. But I don't see how it's not believable that a video of kids being kids (not really kids) can come from a school with high test scores. No matter where you are, at the ages of 14–18 you're going to do ridiculous things and be rowdy. In fact, you probably know that in these schools no one really causes trouble, so that's why the teachers don't shut it down right away because they know it probably won't get too out of control despite how loud it is. I'm guessing within a minute after the video stopped, some high up faculty walks by, tells them to quiet down, and everyone goes back to being normal.
Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
What makes you think it's from the inner city?
If you serve someone back after getting served, then it's on.
Wait... so high school today really IS like it's portrayed in those stupid dance movies?
Just wait until you see their football games. It's not about football at all, it's just an opportunity for each school's marching band to compete with each other.
Oh it's on.
Oh...it's on!
but now it's on....

This is an MRI scan, so it's a cross sectional image.
Exactly. There's no doubt that one is bigger than the other but as far as comparisons go, you can't go in too much details since it's not the same cut.
Correct me if I'm wrong [edit: I am wrong, see /u/Mansy's comment below], but I don't think this isn't an MRI scan. I think it's images taken in a method akin to the Visible Human Project - literally images of frozen cadavers which are photographed cross-sectionally, then a layer is removed (destructively), a new photo taken and so on and so forth.
it's hard to see the plane in which these are taken, but I think those are eyes.
Being fat is unhealthy, same as smoking. We should ultimately respect people's decisions, but I don't see how it's unreasonable to suggest that overweight people lose some weight.
So it's farts.
Jesus the human heart is huge, it's weirding me out man
yeah, I once saw a scan of my chest and all I though was "damn, what the hell is this thing? it's freakin huge!" ... "oh, that's the heart?? :o"
it's all good, You left it on, but you also left the side door open, so I walked in and turned it off.
No, it's more than just that. Look at the muscle development on the interior side of the ankles, and the shape of the ankles themselves. Her disorders are related to more than just being overweight, although i'm sure it's adding additional strain and not improving her situation.
I know jack about MRIs but I'm guessing it's only because of how the MRI take's a 'slice'. It's probably the same reason why the arm bones aren't visible on each women, since they would be angled downwards while laying on a table
It is not healthy that fat people have larger hearts. It's the body's way of adapting to needing to supply more blood. When the heart does this, it is prone to heart-attacks and cardiovascular diseases. Being obese puts tremendous strain on the heart, so no, it's not healthy.
See, it's not bullying.
Yes, it's visceral fat (fat that surrounds the organs). It's very unhealthy to have a significant amount of visceral fat because your body faces a huge risk in heart problems, diabetes and various other health issues.
If it's a CT scan, dark areas are less dense.  You can usually tell if a person has gas by a black area in the stomach.  (disclaimer: I am not a radiologist).  If dark area was shit, then this person inhaled a ton of it into her lungs.
If it's a CT scan ... I suck at reading MRI's though.
No, it's just air. Unfortunately, you won't be able to say "Fat girls are full of shit, I've seen it!"
yeah, i have the same problem getting through doorways as well. not because i'm so large (since i'm 1% bodyfat) but because my dick is 36 inches long and always erect. it's very hard traversing through tight knit indoor environments and sharp turns when you have that much sway and inertia in your lower body.

Gaga has a pretty great voice, it's just not as unique as Adele's-
I think the music biz really is like this. Some guy thought that the "lady gaga" marketing campaign is what was needed. Was it? Would more people have liked her original image? No one can truly say. I think that the perception of the gatekeeper has much more to do with what is inflicted upon us than the reality of what people really like. I mean, it's not as if Adele needed to be marketed as Princess Delly or something with backup dancers in tow.
Yeah, except the whole child prodigy thing. I'm not a fan of her or her music but she apparently has some serious chops. Also pop music is meant to be superficial and vapid. Consequently it's also designed to make a lot of money as well. During every part of modern music there are people that hear whatever is popular and decry how it's leading to the decay of society. It's just not true. Jazz and Rock n' Roll were supposed to lead to the doom of the world, but that never happened. Basically you just shouldn't make sweeping generalizations like that based on the like 2 songs you heard from her.
As a competent guitar player, I'm at the point where I don't like certain players because of the knowledge that being a musician imparts to me. For me one of these players is Slash. As a rock band, G'n'R is pretty great, but I can't just listen to them without analyzing Slash's playing. It sounds good, but it's not great in the guitar realm. When my relatives found out I was a guitar player they all seemed to jump on the "play me Sweet Child" bandwagon but when I explained that I didn't know it because I didn't like Slash, their response was akin to "shut up, he's famous and you're not, so he's done something right."
Meanwhile I was studying SRV, BB King, Townshend, and Hendrix who are arguably more important to rock than Slash. Can you see the disconnect here? It's not even a matter of talent unless the "victim" (for lack of a better word) is going around saying how much better they are than x or y; it's usually a matter of taste.
Let's be honest...lyrically and musically speaking it's all been done before and pretty much half the insane bullshit she does was done by Madonna before her.
oh hey look it's a normal hot person
Oh ok so because you like Bowies music more, so it's ok for him to act weird
the reason she became famous was because of her standing out. She HAD to stand out against the competition, otherwise no one would hear her, she was just another "aspiring" musician. Now, she's a somebody. She has a name. She can be normal if she wants to, but I think she enjoys being OTT, she knows it's working, she makes the headlines with every new outfit she comes up with. Plus, it must be fantastic to be a celebrity and have NO ONE recodnise you out of your "image" :)

I definitely understand where you're coming from and I appreciate the sentiment. I just feel sad when I look at myself and don't see what I would like. I've gotten over any embarrassment with regards to what others think. I'd really like to just be happy with what I have, and most of the time it's not on my mind at all, but if I'm being honest I'd love to fill in shirts and dresses better, not bust out of them, but just fit properly so they aren't hanging off of me. I hate clothes shopping and that's a big part of why, nothing is really designed for flat girls. Not in my income range anyway.
it's ok. small chested girls make me have a sad too.
It's probably because for her, it's about what she likes, not about what you do.
I don't think it's what she likes.  I think it's what she thinks that the world likes.
That's not a good thing. It's like saying, "Your breasts are so small, it's just like you had breast cancer and got them removed!"
Next time my girlfriend complains about her boobs I'll let her know that it's OK, at least she can wear suspenders.
Not that it's really the same thing but that's like telling a fat person "don't worry there's a ton of people who have fat fetishes!"
Obviously having small boobs is commonly more preferred than being fat but it's still not a super conforming sentiment.
Yeah, the way I see it.......okay, it's nice that you and others like small boobs, that people find them attractive. But I don't. And I'm the one who has to live with 'em.
Definitely still need a sports bra - though you're right that it's probably no where near as uncomfortable. They still bounce a little bit.
Not that I play golf but I've heard that it's also easier with small breasts.

It seems like it's always 8/10
It's not really that we have a monopoly on Reddit's advertising system, it's just that there are not a lot of advertisers on Reddit in general. We actually pay the minimum amount required per day to advertise ($30 per subreddit), and are usually competing with a few different ads each day. Redditors love the site, the 5K+ upvotes and comments are all legit (as krispykrackers confirmed above), and this ad brings us a ton of new visitors, so it's worthwhile for us to keep this ad running every day.
It's because it's the same thread being promoted, those are the same comments you see everytime.
Edit: As CrasyMike brilliantly put it, it's Not Safe For Wallet.
Because it's "Not Safe for Wallet" - it's appropriately marked.

Hahaha I think it was a bigger problem when the comics code authority cracked down on them. They had to create villains that weren't overtly threatening. Now it's the opposite, everyone's trying to out-grit and out-brutalize each other.
"Apelsin - Kolsyrad läskedryck" Basically means that it's orange flavored carbonated soda.
Not that anyone would likely crack it open and drink it... but if it's been in storage for roughly as long as it is old without severe agitation, all the syrup and additives have come out of suspension... the top part is all carbonated water, and the lower part is all syrup and coloring.
I cracked a Pepsi from dad's cupboard and realized that the soda was bland-- thought, "oh... it's just caffeine free... and flavor free."  So I poured it in the sink and it came out clear followed by brown sludge.
There is a protective liner along the inside of the can, protecting the metal from the liquid, however it is easily punctured, particularly if the can has ever been dented (either by you or somewhere along the process shipping from the factory to the store). Once that happens, it's not a question of if but when it will begin to leak everywhere and destroy everything you hold dear.

Your park rating will drop, but it's oh so fun.
It was one of those deals where they released almost the exact same game but with a few minor changes and called it '2'. There are new rides and things, it's more or less an expansion park.
The only really notable difference is that you could stack scenery. In the first one you could only build little walls on the grass, but once you are able to stack scenery, you can work upward too, so it allowed you to build little houses and things, with roofs and that. This made little difference to the game, but once the modding community got hold of it, they made their own scenery, and used this new stacking ability to make incredibly complex structures and things. Just take a look at the links I provided, it's amazing, but still so time consuming; each piece on each square is placed by hand.
But you're forgetting it's called Universe Sandbox.
check out GOG...they sometimes have sales too and it's DRM free

That's what reddit's for.
Actually, it's >7 billion now.
Every 150 minutes there is 1 year of video uploaded, that is INCREDIBLE. My mind is blown just trying to comprehend consuming that much content and it's uploaded EVERY 150 minutes!
Reddit isn't useful to me because it's a link aggregator or a forum. It's useful because it's a scalable and universal system for screening content, from videos to products to music or fashion. Google has spent the last few years trying to tackle "social search." Reddit ended up doing by accident.
With inflation it's more like over 9.86 based on this huffpost article.
The problem that drives reposts isn't a lack of content - it's a lack of good content, and good ways to separate the good from the bad. The reason we get reposts is that they've already gotten past the "is this good or bad?" filter, and so can be depended on. If good content is a needle in a stack of shit, then reposts are all those needles that have been painstakingly grabbed from the shit and already set aside.
If you filter out videos of cats and crap lets plays, it's about 30 minutes.
This is strongly in line with the lifestyle of it's founder and CEO, Tristam Shandy.

Ya know sometimes, as a parent, it's just better to let your kid not eat their peas and green beans if they don't want to.
Because parents are supposed to be proud when their children kill or die for their country, not when they speak up when it's illegal or may offend people.
the speaking up I can deal with it's their right as humans to do so, the breaking and entering, destruction of property and assault I cannot.
It's an acceptable form of justice as far as I'm concerned since it's not changing the law it's just bending it so it doesn't create any dangerous precedents (i.e. they would of been charged with what they were charged with regardless but likely wouldn't of gotten anywhere near the max sentence if it wasn't for all this other stuff I'm guessing).
No. Tolokonnikova was one of the founders and leaders, not simply a member. Samutsevich was one of the other members of Voina as you can see from their video and photo reports. As for other two pussy riot members (one of which wasn't caught), it's not clear at all, since neither group has listed their membership for their own safety sake.
Because it's a horrible travesty to the values of the civilized and democratic world, which Russia half-heartedly pretends to be a part of.
I was born in the Soviet Union, and I guess it's clear why the West abandoned us after World War 2.
They're not progressive. They have never fought for anything in their lives. They're a typical US shopper/worker with a cozy priviliged life. In a bubble like that it's difficult to understand.
You're right, but as I said a few times now, it's almost guaranteed that their previous criminal history comes into consideration when a sentence is being handed down hence the 2 years they received.
Fun fact: there's a purposefully funny Russian dub of the Lord of the Rings, and Mordor becomes Mordovia, Gondor becomes Honduras, etc. In Russian it's hilarious.
I'm glad to have more facts, glad to have read the article. But I found it grating that the author emphasized what the facilities used to be used for by a different government. I get the symbolism here. The right way to handle this is to point out the symbolism and then report accurately about the current conditions at these facilities. Propaganda bothers me, even when it's for "my side."
This may be true, but to put bullshit quoted by them in the headline in such a way will make it seem like it's the truth.  Such a line should be in the article, and it should be followed with a debunking, but it shouldn't be the headline, as that will mislead people and the media knows this.
... but it's for their "singing", and not their activism, so it's completely justified.
that raises the question about the legitimacy of the protest, not the power => it's counterproductive

Use sacrificial drone comb - make absolutely sure it's removed while brood still capped
Interesting other issue are bats are coming down with the white nose syndrome (fungus) which is killing them off. They eat insects, and it's entirely possible that not only are we killing insects but in turn we are killing the animals that eat insects, too.
Maybe it's just me but I never really understood why people thought it was a great idea to spray poison all over and why they are surprised when it kills things. I mean, it doesn't take "human poison" to kill me - could be rat poison, could be weed poison, could be bug poison. Likewise with other life forms.
That's not what I meant, I guess I was unclear. What I meant is that it's unsurprising to me that pesticide and herbicide causes massive "collateral damage" to bees, seeing as how pesticide and herbicide at those levels would cause the same damage to most animals.
Sorry, I guess my comment was unclear. What I mean is that since obviously we spend some effort checking crops to make sure that the very small levels of residual pesticide/herbicide do not harm humans, it's utterly unsurprising that much higher levels of pesticide and herbicide harm bees.
Those insects become resistant to that pesticide (or it's found to be too toxic) and they stop it's use, and use something else.  And the cycle repeats.
someone finds a new article, or a new article finds old research.  And every time informed people groan because it's fairly well established as a bunch of causes, and pesticides aren't necessarily even a top one.
This research is important and novel because it's replicating field-level exposures on bumblebee colonies of two pesticides (a neonicitinoid and a pyrethroid) in combination as well as individually, this hasn't been done before.
Heck it's one of the reasons GM foods are so important. Because the current nuke spray effect of pesticides is far more harmful then the controlled levels plants naturally produce, and if we can replicate nature, it'll probably be better for everyone.
I don't think news articles paint the picture right.  There's company involvement all over the place, but most farms, in the states I have lived in, are actually owned and operated by farmers, then they give their crops to a pool/company that distributes.  If a company owns a farm, it's a company started by the family that started the farm.  I have two grandmothers that own a substantial amount of family farms, which act as their retirement income.  The farm is still mostly operated by family members though.
So since Agent Orange is a defoliant it's safe to eat.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11vz4g/amazon_closes_womans_account_and_wipes_her_kindle/
According to this interview with Linn, it appears that she bought her first Kindle used,  so it's not entirely inconceivable that it's related to the account tied to the previous owner of that Kindle.
I should add that in addition to emailing, I did call, several times. While it's hard to say if it helped, it was definitely more helpful than emailing.
I only got back a really surley fuck you type message. So then I inquired again politely and got the same shitty response back. Took the gloves off and, without any actual threats, etc mind you, just a bit of a tyraid on how they could treat their customers this way it's not right, etc etc, some tech emails me back saying I'm being threatening and has called the cops on me.
Amazon is now going to release a statement explaining what happened, and it's going to turn out that this woman's Credit Card information has been used in multiple other accounts and Amazon was basically just shutting down all the accounts so that card can't be used anymore on their site.
THAT SAID, how Amazon's handling this is bullshit and they should absolutely be providing her with enough information to know exactly what's going on.  Plus, of course, it's rather troubling to think that your Kindle and everything you purchased for it could be wiped out entirely at the whim of Amazon, with no recourse besides legal action.
Either way, while I'm not saying it's impossible this is 100% an error on Amazon's part, I'm still guessing there's more to the story on the customer's end than we're hearing.
I had a similar problem with Amazon, I think for them it's par for the course to not provide any details why they close an account. I tried calling them a few times - at one time one of the customer reps said that there was no problem with my account, but with an account from a customer in another city who has the same name as I do. (Fine, I have an relatively unusual name, but not that unusual. And really - the credit card details say where I live, so why is that an issue?)
In my experience it's fairly typical for large companies not to provide details in cases which are related to some kind of account fraud or related abuse. The more details they make available, the more vulnerable their detection tech is to gaming by scammers.
It's pretty baffling all around, so don't think I'm defending Amazon TOO much here.  I'm just saying, it's still safe to assume that companies have a purpose to their actions, at least most of the time.
With that said, this post is disturbing.  Regardless of whether she did or didn't do something wrong, or Amazon simply made a mistake, it's not good that we're headed in a direction where large corporations "own" what you "buy" and have the ability to repossess or destroy it with no explanation, no due process and no viable recourse.
I'm sure I've used terms like "purchased" to describe digital media before. I just wanted to use this opportunity to point out the distinction to people who might not otherwise know about it, because it's very relevant to the discussion at hand.
That's probably the most sensible idea. If she lost enough to be worth her time then she should at least contact the amazon legal department and say if it's not sorted out then she will take legal action.
See, the problem is, when I see Amazon could suspend my account by mistake and deny me access to the stuff I bought from them, not tell me why or otherwise try to help fix the mistake, and my only recourse would be to get a lawyer and perhaps go to court, as a potential customer it just doesn't make me want to do business with them. It's too risky and complicated. And it's their loss more than it is mine.
Digital media with restrictions like this should be treated for what they are: rentals. As such, they are only deserving of a rental's price. This is why I never spend more than $10 for a Steam game, or $1-2 for an eBook. If it's not mine, then it's still the seller's, in which case they don't deserve full price for it.
Interestingly enough, only Apple has thus far actually moved to a model embracing technology's strengths without the inane restrictions, but even there it's only with music (and still limited to lossy formats).
This. Also, it's not Amazon deciding on whether an e-book should have DRM or not, it's the publishers. Amazon's actually been fighting a huge legal battle against the publishers, in behalf of their customers to prevent the fucked-up pricing that's been happening (e-books costing as much, and sometimes more than the hard cover version).
The point here isn't who caused the problem, the point here is that Amazon isn't even trying to help this customer fix it. The worst part, for me, is where they stated that "any subsequent account" would be closed as well. What the actual fuck? This is essentially banning the person altogether. I don't think it's wrong to terminate the account of someone who broke the rules, but to keep terminating any new accounts after they've learned a lesson? That's just mean and hostile. And especially so if you refuse to tell the person why you banned them to begin with.
It's shitty, but well within the terms of service, and it's something people should be aware of before they tie so much of their life/purchases to an account that could be closed on a whim.
The problem is when problems occur which the customer service agent in India isn't capable of solving.  This is when you see the beautiful surface of Amazon peel away and what's left is a rotten core of cold heartless automation, the Hades of customer service.  By definition you will get absolutely no assistance here because it's completely devoid of human thought or compassion; again, Amazon is built to ignore the most time consuming customers.  They don't want you, and thus your complaints will be met with mindless form emails until you give up and leave.  Amazon: 1, Annoying Customer: 0.
Believe it or not, I still shop at Amazon because their shopping system is far and away the best.  And if something goes wrong I'm sure I can usually get a decent remedy.  But I have no illusions about the way the company works behind the scenes.  I hope nobody here personally has to deal with Amazon on the same level I did, because it's hell.
No, but it's how many businesses behave as soon as there is the slightest whiff of something that interests the "security" department.
It's usually an issue of some dipshit who loves the power they have to close accounts and goes overboard in assuming somethings bad or fishy when it's not. Once these folks close accounts, it usually took someone higher up like me to MAKE them understand they did a bad thing and open the account back up. Even then, they would smirk and say they weren't wrong. It was absurd.
E: Looks like the Internet killed the blog site. Basically it's someone saying Amazon killed his friend's account and remotely wiped her Kindle because the account was 'related to an existing closed account', and in the following email chain tells her any future accounts will also be closed and refuses to tell her any further details and ends with "we're not going to discuss the matter further" and "thank you for understanding our decision"
Yeah, I mean it's not like they are playing fair. It's a capitalist system, it pays off to be an opportunist, they take advantages of the system and it's fine. But when your avarage Joe does it, it is wrong?
I also don't like this weird digital-age notion content producers have that they can take back what they sold you. If a copy of a file on your computer is considered an "item" (as they insist it is when pirates "publish" millions of copies), and you've bought it, then it's theft for them to take it back. Imagine if publishers (or recording studios, or movie studios) were allowed to walk into your home and box up your books, movies, and DVDs. I would call the goddamn cops on them, and they would go to jail, because that's theft.
She probably violated some form of terms or contract a person does when registering their product. Rarely happens, except they took action. They may not be informing her of her breach do to reason of pursuing other activity related to her account. Although not fair it's my game plan if I was Amazon. Possible she was taking copywritten material and posting that data elsewhere. Uploading to torrents. Honestly a little extreme.

What wouldn't surprise me is hearing something equivalent from Obama. After 3 thankless years of trying to turn around problems he didn't create, while taking all the blame for it, he's still out there campaigning and trying to do the job again. Fucking amazing that he isn't up there going "Hey Romney it's all yours. Good luck, buddy. I'm going to go sit on a beach and watch the world burn."
He's saying the salesman needs to make more money for his family for when he dies. I mean it's either cars or blue meth.
That's because it's been conveniently left out of the media narrative.
Mitt Romney was born in 1947, meaning he would have been 19 in 1966. Age 19 is exactly in the age range where every male member of the LDS church goes on a mission. It's not "convenient", it's just how LDS missions work.
Former Mormon here, not every 19 year old boy goes on a mission, it's a choice. So he clearly chose to do that while avoiding the draft. There were plenty of men that chose the opposite even though they were Mormon 19 year olds.
The problem isn't just in the federal government as an organism, it's in individual government officials that have no integrity.
Unfortunately, there are enough people out there who take religion seriously enough that it's not very pragmatic to mock them in public.  It's not like you have to fall back on his religion to make Romney look ridiculous, anyway.
I think it's more that the title it's without context rather than being misleading. The title just quotes Romney.  I didn't interpret that to mean he running to make money at all (he's a billionaire for chrissake -- who becomes president for the $$?)
They can't fathom that, there are many people who have conservative parents or upbringing, and yet became liberals because /r/politics is not distorting information, it's linking to well-researched news articles by journalists. In the age of the internet, we can check and verify, the truthfulness of /r/politics, and yet these people are flat out saying "LIBERAL MEDIA"; one person in /r/askreddit, got downvoted for saying 'liberal media myth', and people accused him of liberal bias. Anything that doesn't fit their conservative worldview == liberal bias and thus false!
We're calling them "Low information voters" until the middle of November when it's okay to offend them again.
What I can't figure out -- and I've spoken to a number of teachers about it, and no one knows -- is who actually believes this bullshit.  Someone, somewhere, is making policy that no one can fail, that the tests are unfair, that if the material were just taught differently than every child would be smart.  But I don't know who these people are, or why they believe this way.  Hell, I can't even figure out who decided they should stop keeping score in softball; everyone acknowledges that it's bullshit, but that's just the way it's played now.
To be fair, what about all the black voters that came out in 2008 that never voted a day in their life? I do understand that it's a bit different coming from a minority group. On the other hand, I don't feel like the same voters would come out if it was someone like Herman Cain.
the polls are incredibly inaccurate. take this poll for instance, it's the only poll putting Romney ahead.
It's the same brain washing that keeps kids in at night and teaches them to brush their teeth, so let's not take that thought process TOO far.  It comes down to humans being limited in their abilities.  The spectrum is so wide, so vast that anyone wanting to cast a wide political net must first chose to generalized a possibly misleading message, and every political message needs a boogey-man.  When you look at the messages closely it's clear - Democrats blame the republicans, themselves and the past.  The republicans blame anyone but themselves at all costs, and they almost always blame the opponent as a part of their opening line, and then go on to vaguely offer a solution, to be explained and executed AFTER the republican is placed in office.  I'm not saying the democrats are being honest or informed in their description of the placed blame, but I am saying that when a kid comes up to you and blames everyone in the world but himself for the broken lamp, it's pretty clear what happened. Now in this scenario with a broken lamp, a kid with an excuse, and mom the results are clear, but what if this house is full of a LOT of other kids and some adults, but everyone gets equal votes?  That kid with the explanation of what went wrong simply has to speak more loudly and keep his story on track to convince enough OTHER kids that his story is true.  That is the simple method in which the republicans ensure the race will always be close these days, vague up the message to everyone, relying on how busy and uninformed people HAVE to be thanks to the limitations of humans in a drowning economy, and always blame the other guy no matter what.  The only thing that can bring down this type of play is an informed public, and so far we ain't gettin' that.
romnesia at it's finest

But it's totally true.  The money is in Washington.  And every President, Senator and Congressmen participates in the corruption.  Even your grand leader ___ (enter name here) is corrupt.  You want real change you need to understand that almost everything you learn in school is a lie to brainwash you into a system of slavery.  Once you know that to be true you can start re-learning the truths of the world and help wake up others.  The only way to change and be free is to educate everyone in what it means to be free.  Religion and Government are here to control you.  These elections mean nothing.  Whoever you vote for will not change things for the better for you, but only change things for the government by consolidation.  The govenment will get bigger and control more and more and make more laws.  And you will still be a worker.  The education system is here to indoctrinate you into thinking you can't survive without being someone's employee - IE: someones slave.  It's never about you being free to live without needing to be an employee.  You don't get taught to own your own land, farm and grow food for yourself.  It's always about you working for someone else, getting paid money to go to the store to buy their crap that you could have grown yourself.   Learn what Serfdom means.  Obama is for big corporations, war, wallstreet, and bailouts for bankers.  Romney is the same.  Make no mistake they are the same.  They want war and money and they don't give a damn about you.  They never did.  Grow up.
Gosh, it's almost like he's a Machiavellian, lying sack of shit.

Even the guy who came up with this argument has apologized and recanted it once he learned how bananas were cultivated to how they are today. So it's doubly stupid to use it. Of course, I'm 90% sure this thing is satire anyway.
Sure, it's possible I haven't looked at some horrendous part, so just correct me if I'm wrong. I'm glad to learn more. I can also give a source if somebody wants it, but I don't have the time right now to look it up.

Why are there still monkeys - We didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and monkeys have a common ancestor. Asking why are there still monkeys is like asking if you came from your cousin, why are your cousins still here -- it's nonsensical.
What humans have a problem in accepting, is the concept that the universe contains the physics that create time and space; it's impossible for us to really grasp the concept of something from nothing, or nothingness itself because we've never experienced nothing, or anything that has no external form.  *if you die and are nothing, the brain cannot reconcile that notion to anything its ever experienced; how can something like our conscious mind become nothing?  It's far easier to think that we are transformed into something else which allows our conscious mind to carry on to eternity (whatever that actually means).
{...}Grand Canyon form? the force of Colorado river. Ever been there? you should, it's an amazing place.
Isn't it awful how that christian who wrote the thing equates homosexuality and pornography to murder and rape? Those are so unrelated it's not even funny, but obviously to a christian homosexuality or self pleasure is so reprehensible it's up there with violence. I would never equate violence (such as rape and murder) to love (be it hetero, homo, or solo)
I think you have it; it's pretty weak.  Look through the blog.  Seems to be Christian baiting.
Why does my cock fit into my hand so nicely if it's a sin to masturbate?
Grand Canyon form" the force of Colorado river. Ever been there? you should, it's an amazing place.
For what it's worth, I'm a Christian, and I'll give my two cents if anyone would be interested.  (if not, downvote oblivion here i come!)
If we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?  Um.  Well, I don't believe we did come from monkeys, so this is a moot question.  But assuming that I did not believe, according to my understanding of evolution, it's not so much that people came from monkeys, but rather that they shared a similar ancestor.
Yes I have.  I don't know if it's real or not, but to me and what I believe in, it changes nothing.

Someone incredibly familiar with the IEM here. It has nothing to do with corn futures. The reason it isn't regulated is because traders can only invest $500. Anything more than that and the CFTC would consider them a gambling house. Honestly, it is 100% betting on the election, but it's used for research and they don't make a profit, so the CFTC says it's cool.
On top of that, Nate Silver would seem to justify Reddit's bias.
I'm currently reading Nate Silver's book, and it's fascinating to see all of the different factors that must be aggregated to make these predictions.  Very interesting stuff.
The media likes to emphasize the popular vote because it's a lot closer than the electoral vote. If people think Obama has it all sewn up they might stop watching the circus.
This personalization has a really negative effect on how we are informed as citizens. Just by browsing Reddit, you'll passively reinforce particular existing views - and even radicalize them. Without any content to counter or challenge the things we want to see, Reddit essentially becomes an echo chamber. We hear what we already think because the website is personalized to us, and because we hear it again, we think it's right. This effect is vastly compounded if Reddit is your only source of news. Because there is no overarching content control, there is no pressure to supply the other side(s) to issues.
Every time I've posted something that's portrays Obama, Liz Warren, etc in a negative light (which always comes from a good source) it's not only not upvoted, it's actively downvoted by numerous people.
I would love a more neutral subreddit with stricter rules on fact checking and serious comments (no puns, lame jokes and other meaningless posts), because it's almost as bad as /r/athesim in there.
There is also an age component at play here.  Reddit's demographic skews toward liberalism.  It also skews heavily toward those who are just out of college or just starting out in careers, aren't making any money yet and feel powerless.  Those folks, by and large, aren't voting for Romney.
There was an article that went out last week that researched Romney's remark during the debate about the President's pension. Politifact looked into it and found out Obama's pension is set up through the Cayman islands with investments in China. It's also much larger than Romney's. This isn't necessarily the Presidents fault as it's a blind investment setup through Illinois but highly hypocritical of his administration to criticize Romney for the same thing.
I was hoping it would garner some actual discussion (and vitriol) but apparently the post just got largely ignored. I suspect it  would have been on the top of /r/politics for weeks if it was Romney. Honestly I think /r/politics should have it's name changed.
Except the point about American politics being shifted right still stands when you look globally comparing America to other Western nations. The point about a shift to the left does not exist when you look outside the US. Seems like one side has a bit more support for it's case.
Except it's not a point of view, it's a fact. In the "left" / "right" political spectrum the true far left would be your socialism/communism (and don't forget anarcho-syndicalist-communes, lol). In meaningful use of the political spectrum there's no confusion.
I think it's the vote system that fucks everything up. It's meant to be used to vote discussions to the top, but it's used to vote dissenting opinions out of existence. Downvoting things you don't personally agree with is not what the system is in place for, but that's sure as hell how it's used.
Rather, it's just "Their conditions are different.  Case closed.  The end.".
I've noticed the whole Romney-is-evil thing here as well, but what's more troubling to me about political discourse on Reddit is how conservatives as a whole are treated. Reading comments on r/politics, you'd think that there's absolutely no logical basis for a conservative ideology. Sure, I disagree with most of what the GOP currently stands for, but it's possible to agree with the party and be an intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate person. Reading Reddit, you don't get a sense of any of that.
Maybe, but since the start of the month Obama has the lead in 4 polls compared to Romney's 8. Most of these leads on both sides are within the margin of error, but still I'd say it's more likely to go for Romney.
However, polls always have a margin of error, and even that margin of error is not an absolute indicator due to the confidence margin or whatever the statistical term is. I.e. a poll can have a 4 point margin of error but a 1 in 20 chance of being off the mark anyways, I think it's called a p-value, I never actually had a class on it all.
Well, seeing as a ton of the posts from r/politics are just retarded blogs, and at least 50% of the posts are filled with top comments saying "this article is complete bullshit" with intelligent discussion as to why, and then the second or third top comment is "People need to see this and wake up! This country is being destroyed. We aren't free! Romney will destroy us all!" I think it's safe to say that we are incredibly distorted. Not that others aren't, but if you believe Reddit isn't a source with a huge democratic bias, you probably don't value facts that much when it comes to making up your mind about something.  The truth and lies that a news article is composed of is like a smoothie of propaganda, which is which is only distinguishable if you put in the time to check sources, reliability, and how much facts are stretched.
On the other hand it's very comfy to be around people whom you agree with, and it creates a nice, self-perpetuating bubble of smug arrogance (as in my post). It does not mean it's not true, but it can make yourself feel more important than you really are.
I also think there's an element of arrogance involved as well. In the sense that it's unacceptable to admit something as important as an American Election could be so one-sided and predictable. American pop culture is all about drama, drama, drama; and there's no drama in a predictable outcome.

Hi Mr Roberts! First I want to thank you for doing this AMA and also for being so brave and challenging the industry and it's BS console focused mindset. This project is one that I personally had given up on ever seeing and I believe it will have a massive impact on the future of gaming. I am very excited.
And an advice about translating the game in other languages if I may: Please keep the names of the cities, planets and other stuff in the original language. WoW made that mistake and it's really annoying and confusing with all the different names of the cities for example.
Will we be able to build as well as purchase? I don't mean in the RTS sense, but will we be able to establish our own base of operations, in the sense that it's not a ship, but a stationary base?
Also, IIRC, it's been stated that in engagements, 'slots' will be reserved for your friends to jump in and help. Does this mean it won't be a 'come and go as you please' universe or am I just mistaken, which I probably am. Already gonna buy, but this clarification would just get me all the more titalated. Thanks!
Or are you aiming at some other point in the spectrum?  I watched the S42 trailer many, many times, and the speeds and distances involved look similar to WCP, but I know it's very early stage and still a prototype tech demo.  Just wanted to know if the trailer is representative of the combat pacing you're aiming for.
First off, thank you for doing this AMA and the work you’ve done in the past. My questions focus primarily on some of the less space sim-y aspects of Star Citizen. I apologize if these questions have already been asked, it's hard to keep track of all the information. If you could answer just one or two I’d appreciate it.
This game seems ambitious on a scale we haven't seen before.  MMO/single/super detail/super fast/open ended it seems like it's tackling every angle at once.
-I feel like doing the 5$ = __ credits right away is removing the "I've earned this item because of my skills/time spent ingame". Do you think it's ahred amongst player, and if so, how are you going to solve that?
I was wondering if you were planning to implement TrackIR support. You're a PC man and I'm assuming you've heard of the device. I know it's not mega-popular, but it enahances the immersion in games in a way I can't even describe.
Also, how in-depth will customization go in the game? Will it only be "skin deep" with colors and such? I understand that the ships have a large number of modeled parts for realistic damage, but could we be provided with a modular custom ship creator? Say I save up a massive amount of money, could I build a custom Cruiser with a small landing bay in back for one or two fighters? Maybe there would be a buch of prefabricated rooms, engines, features and armament that I could arrange how I wanted and then give it it's armored skin over top to finish construction. Is this idea possible? Not possible? Why?
The original Wing Commander and it's sequels were hugely influential on my life.  I credit my career in IT directly with the skills and lessons I learned while learning how to make these games run properly on various computers over the years.
I just want to say, you are amazing!!! I am still playing freelancer (discovery mod) since its really the only space sim that gets it right. It has held up amazingly well for being such an old game, and I'm so excited for the improvements you're bringing to Star Citizen. As an engineer, the fly by wire system has me really excited! I absolutely cannot wait to play this game, and I'm even considering buying a dedicated gaming rig just to play it in all it's glory!

You forgot to put words over it. Reddit won't upvote comments like this unless it's a gif or reiterates the message on the picture.
"This guy is right, for once it's not a video or story about a girl being shot or raped, good on us, for once."
As it seems like none of my previous classmates are redditors I feel it's my duty to defend my school against some of the less constructive comments.
This is Witney M. Young high school and it's a magnet school in Chicago. Top 3 in the city, 4th in the state, and around 135 in the nation. It's pretty funny reading a bunch of comments about this "inner city" school, when in fact the majority of the students in that video are probably enrolled in AP classes and will receive offers of enrollment from some of the top universities in the country.
To be fair, it's not really reddit logic. It's the American middle-class suburb logic.
Haha thank you. Although I do provide some evidence in some of my replies to back up the claim that this school is supposed to be good. But I don't see how it's not believable that a video of kids being kids (not really kids) can come from a school with high test scores. No matter where you are, at the ages of 14–18 you're going to do ridiculous things and be rowdy. In fact, you probably know that in these schools no one really causes trouble, so that's why the teachers don't shut it down right away because they know it probably won't get too out of control despite how loud it is. I'm guessing within a minute after the video stopped, some high up faculty walks by, tells them to quiet down, and everyone goes back to being normal.
Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
What makes you think it's from the inner city?
If you serve someone back after getting served, then it's on.
Wait... so high school today really IS like it's portrayed in those stupid dance movies?
Just wait until you see their football games. It's not about football at all, it's just an opportunity for each school's marching band to compete with each other.
Oh it's on.
Oh...it's on!
but now it's on....

This is an MRI scan, so it's a cross sectional image.
Exactly. There's no doubt that one is bigger than the other but as far as comparisons go, you can't go in too much details since it's not the same cut.
Correct me if I'm wrong [edit: I am wrong, see /u/Mansy's comment below], but I don't think this isn't an MRI scan. I think it's images taken in a method akin to the Visible Human Project - literally images of frozen cadavers which are photographed cross-sectionally, then a layer is removed (destructively), a new photo taken and so on and so forth.
it's hard to see the plane in which these are taken, but I think those are eyes.
Being fat is unhealthy, same as smoking. We should ultimately respect people's decisions, but I don't see how it's unreasonable to suggest that overweight people lose some weight.
So it's farts.
Jesus the human heart is huge, it's weirding me out man
yeah, I once saw a scan of my chest and all I though was "damn, what the hell is this thing? it's freakin huge!" ... "oh, that's the heart?? :o"
it's all good, You left it on, but you also left the side door open, so I walked in and turned it off.
No, it's more than just that. Look at the muscle development on the interior side of the ankles, and the shape of the ankles themselves. Her disorders are related to more than just being overweight, although i'm sure it's adding additional strain and not improving her situation.
I know jack about MRIs but I'm guessing it's only because of how the MRI take's a 'slice'. It's probably the same reason why the arm bones aren't visible on each women, since they would be angled downwards while laying on a table
It is not healthy that fat people have larger hearts. It's the body's way of adapting to needing to supply more blood. When the heart does this, it is prone to heart-attacks and cardiovascular diseases. Being obese puts tremendous strain on the heart, so no, it's not healthy.
See, it's not bullying.
Yes, it's visceral fat (fat that surrounds the organs). It's very unhealthy to have a significant amount of visceral fat because your body faces a huge risk in heart problems, diabetes and various other health issues.
If it's a CT scan, dark areas are less dense.  You can usually tell if a person has gas by a black area in the stomach.  (disclaimer: I am not a radiologist).  If dark area was shit, then this person inhaled a ton of it into her lungs.
If it's a CT scan ... I suck at reading MRI's though.
No, it's just air. Unfortunately, you won't be able to say "Fat girls are full of shit, I've seen it!"
yeah, i have the same problem getting through doorways as well. not because i'm so large (since i'm 1% bodyfat) but because my dick is 36 inches long and always erect. it's very hard traversing through tight knit indoor environments and sharp turns when you have that much sway and inertia in your lower body.

Gaga has a pretty great voice, it's just not as unique as Adele's-
I think the music biz really is like this. Some guy thought that the "lady gaga" marketing campaign is what was needed. Was it? Would more people have liked her original image? No one can truly say. I think that the perception of the gatekeeper has much more to do with what is inflicted upon us than the reality of what people really like. I mean, it's not as if Adele needed to be marketed as Princess Delly or something with backup dancers in tow.
Yeah, except the whole child prodigy thing. I'm not a fan of her or her music but she apparently has some serious chops. Also pop music is meant to be superficial and vapid. Consequently it's also designed to make a lot of money as well. During every part of modern music there are people that hear whatever is popular and decry how it's leading to the decay of society. It's just not true. Jazz and Rock n' Roll were supposed to lead to the doom of the world, but that never happened. Basically you just shouldn't make sweeping generalizations like that based on the like 2 songs you heard from her.
As a competent guitar player, I'm at the point where I don't like certain players because of the knowledge that being a musician imparts to me. For me one of these players is Slash. As a rock band, G'n'R is pretty great, but I can't just listen to them without analyzing Slash's playing. It sounds good, but it's not great in the guitar realm. When my relatives found out I was a guitar player they all seemed to jump on the "play me Sweet Child" bandwagon but when I explained that I didn't know it because I didn't like Slash, their response was akin to "shut up, he's famous and you're not, so he's done something right."
Meanwhile I was studying SRV, BB King, Townshend, and Hendrix who are arguably more important to rock than Slash. Can you see the disconnect here? It's not even a matter of talent unless the "victim" (for lack of a better word) is going around saying how much better they are than x or y; it's usually a matter of taste.
Let's be honest...lyrically and musically speaking it's all been done before and pretty much half the insane bullshit she does was done by Madonna before her.
oh hey look it's a normal hot person
Oh ok so because you like Bowies music more, so it's ok for him to act weird
the reason she became famous was because of her standing out. She HAD to stand out against the competition, otherwise no one would hear her, she was just another "aspiring" musician. Now, she's a somebody. She has a name. She can be normal if she wants to, but I think she enjoys being OTT, she knows it's working, she makes the headlines with every new outfit she comes up with. Plus, it must be fantastic to be a celebrity and have NO ONE recodnise you out of your "image" :)

...With Reddit's ability to hit on anyone as soon as they find out someone's a woman?
I definitely understand where you're coming from and I appreciate the sentiment. I just feel sad when I look at myself and don't see what I would like. I've gotten over any embarrassment with regards to what others think. I'd really like to just be happy with what I have, and most of the time it's not on my mind at all, but if I'm being honest I'd love to fill in shirts and dresses better, not bust out of them, but just fit properly so they aren't hanging off of me. I hate clothes shopping and that's a big part of why, nothing is really designed for flat girls. Not in my income range anyway.
it's ok. small chested girls make me have a sad too.
It's probably because for her, it's about what she likes, not about what you do.
I don't think it's what she likes.  I think it's what she thinks that the world likes.
That's not a good thing. It's like saying, "Your breasts are so small, it's just like you had breast cancer and got them removed!"
Next time my girlfriend complains about her boobs I'll let her know that it's OK, at least she can wear suspenders.
Not that it's really the same thing but that's like telling a fat person "don't worry there's a ton of people who have fat fetishes!"
Obviously having small boobs is commonly more preferred than being fat but it's still not a super conforming sentiment.
Yeah, the way I see it.......okay, it's nice that you and others like small boobs, that people find them attractive. But I don't. And I'm the one who has to live with 'em.
Definitely still need a sports bra - though you're right that it's probably no where near as uncomfortable. They still bounce a little bit.
Not that I play golf but I've heard that it's also easier with small breasts.

It seems like it's always 8/10
It's not really that we have a monopoly on Reddit's advertising system, it's just that there are not a lot of advertisers on Reddit in general. We actually pay the minimum amount required per day to advertise ($30 per subreddit), and are usually competing with a few different ads each day. Redditors love the site, the 5K+ upvotes and comments are all legit (as krispykrackers confirmed above), and this ad brings us a ton of new visitors, so it's worthwhile for us to keep this ad running every day.
It's because it's the same thread being promoted, those are the same comments you see everytime.

Hahaha I think it was a bigger problem when the comics code authority cracked down on them. They had to create villains that weren't overtly threatening. Now it's the opposite, everyone's trying to out-grit and out-brutalize each other.
"Apelsin - Kolsyrad läskedryck" Basically means that it's orange flavored carbonated soda.
Not that anyone would likely crack it open and drink it... but if it's been in storage for roughly as long as it is old without severe agitation, all the syrup and additives have come out of suspension... the top part is all carbonated water, and the lower part is all syrup and coloring.
I cracked a Pepsi from dad's cupboard and realized that the soda was bland-- thought, "oh... it's just caffeine free... and flavor free."  So I poured it in the sink and it came out clear followed by brown sludge.
There is a protective liner along the inside of the can, protecting the metal from the liquid, however it is easily punctured, particularly if the can has ever been dented (either by you or somewhere along the process shipping from the factory to the store). Once that happens, it's not a question of if but when it will begin to leak everywhere and destroy everything you hold dear.

Your park rating will drop, but it's oh so fun.
It was one of those deals where they released almost the exact same game but with a few minor changes and called it '2'. There are new rides and things, it's more or less an expansion park.
The only really notable difference is that you could stack scenery. In the first one you could only build little walls on the grass, but once you are able to stack scenery, you can work upward too, so it allowed you to build little houses and things, with roofs and that. This made little difference to the game, but once the modding community got hold of it, they made their own scenery, and used this new stacking ability to make incredibly complex structures and things. Just take a look at the links I provided, it's amazing, but still so time consuming; each piece on each square is placed by hand.
But you're forgetting it's called Universe Sandbox.
check out GOG...they sometimes have sales too and it's DRM free

That's what reddit's for.
Actually, it's >7 billion now.
Every 150 minutes there is 1 year of video uploaded, that is INCREDIBLE. My mind is blown just trying to comprehend consuming that much content and it's uploaded EVERY 150 minutes!
Reddit isn't useful to me because it's a link aggregator or a forum. It's useful because it's a scalable and universal system for screening content, from videos to products to music or fashion. Google has spent the last few years trying to tackle "social search." Reddit ended up doing by accident.
With inflation it's more like over 9.86 based on this huffpost article.
The problem that drives reposts isn't a lack of content - it's a lack of good content, and good ways to separate the good from the bad. The reason we get reposts is that they've already gotten past the "is this good or bad?" filter, and so can be depended on. If good content is a needle in a stack of shit, then reposts are all those needles that have been painstakingly grabbed from the shit and already set aside.
If you filter out videos of cats and crap lets plays, it's about 30 minutes.
This is strongly in line with the lifestyle of it's founder and CEO, Tristam Shandy.

Ya know sometimes, as a parent, it's just better to let your kid not eat their peas and green beans if they don't want to.
Because parents are supposed to be proud when their children kill or die for their country, not when they speak up when it's illegal or may offend people.
the speaking up I can deal with it's their right as humans to do so, the breaking and entering, destruction of property and assault I cannot.
It's an acceptable form of justice as far as I'm concerned since it's not changing the law it's just bending it so it doesn't create any dangerous precedents (i.e. they would of been charged with what they were charged with regardless but likely wouldn't of gotten anywhere near the max sentence if it wasn't for all this other stuff I'm guessing).
No. Tolokonnikova was one of the founders and leaders, not simply a member. Samutsevich was one of the other members of Voina as you can see from their video and photo reports. As for other two pussy riot members (one of which wasn't caught), it's not clear at all, since neither group has listed their membership for their own safety sake.
Because it's a horrible travesty to the values of the civilized and democratic world, which Russia half-heartedly pretends to be a part of.
I was born in the Soviet Union, and I guess it's clear why the West abandoned us after World War 2.
They're not progressive. They have never fought for anything in their lives. They're a typical US shopper/worker with a cozy priviliged life. In a bubble like that it's difficult to understand.
You're right, but as I said a few times now, it's almost guaranteed that their previous criminal history comes into consideration when a sentence is being handed down hence the 2 years they received.
Fun fact: there's a purposefully funny Russian dub of the Lord of the Rings, and Mordor becomes Mordovia, Gondor becomes Honduras, etc. In Russian it's hilarious.
I'm glad to have more facts, glad to have read the article. But I found it grating that the author emphasized what the facilities used to be used for by a different government. I get the symbolism here. The right way to handle this is to point out the symbolism and then report accurately about the current conditions at these facilities. Propaganda bothers me, even when it's for "my side."
This may be true, but to put bullshit quoted by them in the headline in such a way will make it seem like it's the truth.  Such a line should be in the article, and it should be followed with a debunking, but it shouldn't be the headline, as that will mislead people and the media knows this.
... but it's for their "singing", and not their activism, so it's completely justified.
that raises the question about the legitimacy of the protest, not the power => it's counterproductive

Use sacrificial drone comb - make absolutely sure it's removed while brood still capped
Interesting other issue are bats are coming down with the white nose syndrome (fungus) which is killing them off. They eat insects, and it's entirely possible that not only are we killing insects but in turn we are killing the animals that eat insects, too.
Maybe it's just me but I never really understood why people thought it was a great idea to spray poison all over and why they are surprised when it kills things. I mean, it doesn't take "human poison" to kill me - could be rat poison, could be weed poison, could be bug poison. Likewise with other life forms.
That's not what I meant, I guess I was unclear. What I meant is that it's unsurprising to me that pesticide and herbicide causes massive "collateral damage" to bees, seeing as how pesticide and herbicide at those levels would cause the same damage to most animals.
Sorry, I guess my comment was unclear. What I mean is that since obviously we spend some effort checking crops to make sure that the very small levels of residual pesticide/herbicide do not harm humans, it's utterly unsurprising that much higher levels of pesticide and herbicide harm bees.
Those insects become resistant to that pesticide (or it's found to be too toxic) and they stop it's use, and use something else.  And the cycle repeats.
someone finds a new article, or a new article finds old research.  And every time informed people groan because it's fairly well established as a bunch of causes, and pesticides aren't necessarily even a top one.
This research is important and novel because it's replicating field-level exposures on bumblebee colonies of two pesticides (a neonicitinoid and a pyrethroid) in combination as well as individually, this hasn't been done before.
Heck it's one of the reasons GM foods are so important. Because the current nuke spray effect of pesticides is far more harmful then the controlled levels plants naturally produce, and if we can replicate nature, it'll probably be better for everyone.
I don't think news articles paint the picture right.  There's company involvement all over the place, but most farms, in the states I have lived in, are actually owned and operated by farmers, then they give their crops to a pool/company that distributes.  If a company owns a farm, it's a company started by the family that started the farm.  I have two grandmothers that own a substantial amount of family farms, which act as their retirement income.  The farm is still mostly operated by family members though.
So since Agent Orange is a defoliant it's safe to eat.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11vz4g/amazon_closes_womans_account_and_wipes_her_kindle/
According to this interview with Linn, it appears that she bought her first Kindle used,  so it's not entirely inconceivable that it's related to the account tied to the previous owner of that Kindle.
I should add that in addition to emailing, I did call, several times. While it's hard to say if it helped, it was definitely more helpful than emailing.
I only got back a really surley fuck you type message. So then I inquired again politely and got the same shitty response back. Took the gloves off and, without any actual threats, etc mind you, just a bit of a tyraid on how they could treat their customers this way it's not right, etc etc, some tech emails me back saying I'm being threatening and has called the cops on me.
Amazon is now going to release a statement explaining what happened, and it's going to turn out that this woman's Credit Card information has been used in multiple other accounts and Amazon was basically just shutting down all the accounts so that card can't be used anymore on their site.
THAT SAID, how Amazon's handling this is bullshit and they should absolutely be providing her with enough information to know exactly what's going on.  Plus, of course, it's rather troubling to think that your Kindle and everything you purchased for it could be wiped out entirely at the whim of Amazon, with no recourse besides legal action.
Either way, while I'm not saying it's impossible this is 100% an error on Amazon's part, I'm still guessing there's more to the story on the customer's end than we're hearing.
I had a similar problem with Amazon, I think for them it's par for the course to not provide any details why they close an account. I tried calling them a few times - at one time one of the customer reps said that there was no problem with my account, but with an account from a customer in another city who has the same name as I do. (Fine, I have an relatively unusual name, but not that unusual. And really - the credit card details say where I live, so why is that an issue?)
In my experience it's fairly typical for large companies not to provide details in cases which are related to some kind of account fraud or related abuse. The more details they make available, the more vulnerable their detection tech is to gaming by scammers.
It's pretty baffling all around, so don't think I'm defending Amazon TOO much here.  I'm just saying, it's still safe to assume that companies have a purpose to their actions, at least most of the time.
With that said, this post is disturbing.  Regardless of whether she did or didn't do something wrong, or Amazon simply made a mistake, it's not good that we're headed in a direction where large corporations "own" what you "buy" and have the ability to repossess or destroy it with no explanation, no due process and no viable recourse.
I'm sure I've used terms like "purchased" to describe digital media before. I just wanted to use this opportunity to point out the distinction to people who might not otherwise know about it, because it's very relevant to the discussion at hand.
That's probably the most sensible idea. If she lost enough to be worth her time then she should at least contact the amazon legal department and say if it's not sorted out then she will take legal action.
See, the problem is, when I see Amazon could suspend my account by mistake and deny me access to the stuff I bought from them, not tell me why or otherwise try to help fix the mistake, and my only recourse would be to get a lawyer and perhaps go to court, as a potential customer it just doesn't make me want to do business with them. It's too risky and complicated. And it's their loss more than it is mine.
Digital media with restrictions like this should be treated for what they are: rentals. As such, they are only deserving of a rental's price. This is why I never spend more than $10 for a Steam game, or $1-2 for an eBook. If it's not mine, then it's still the seller's, in which case they don't deserve full price for it.
Interestingly enough, only Apple has thus far actually moved to a model embracing technology's strengths without the inane restrictions, but even there it's only with music (and still limited to lossy formats).
This. Also, it's not Amazon deciding on whether an e-book should have DRM or not, it's the publishers. Amazon's actually been fighting a huge legal battle against the publishers, in behalf of their customers to prevent the fucked-up pricing that's been happening (e-books costing as much, and sometimes more than the hard cover version).
The point here isn't who caused the problem, the point here is that Amazon isn't even trying to help this customer fix it. The worst part, for me, is where they stated that "any subsequent account" would be closed as well. What the actual fuck? This is essentially banning the person altogether. I don't think it's wrong to terminate the account of someone who broke the rules, but to keep terminating any new accounts after they've learned a lesson? That's just mean and hostile. And especially so if you refuse to tell the person why you banned them to begin with.
It's shitty, but well within the terms of service, and it's something people should be aware of before they tie so much of their life/purchases to an account that could be closed on a whim.
The problem is when problems occur which the customer service agent in India isn't capable of solving.  This is when you see the beautiful surface of Amazon peel away and what's left is a rotten core of cold heartless automation, the Hades of customer service.  By definition you will get absolutely no assistance here because it's completely devoid of human thought or compassion; again, Amazon is built to ignore the most time consuming customers.  They don't want you, and thus your complaints will be met with mindless form emails until you give up and leave.  Amazon: 1, Annoying Customer: 0.
Believe it or not, I still shop at Amazon because their shopping system is far and away the best.  And if something goes wrong I'm sure I can usually get a decent remedy.  But I have no illusions about the way the company works behind the scenes.  I hope nobody here personally has to deal with Amazon on the same level I did, because it's hell.
No, but it's how many businesses behave as soon as there is the slightest whiff of something that interests the "security" department.
It's usually an issue of some dipshit who loves the power they have to close accounts and goes overboard in assuming somethings bad or fishy when it's not. Once these folks close accounts, it usually took someone higher up like me to MAKE them understand they did a bad thing and open the account back up. Even then, they would smirk and say they weren't wrong. It was absurd.
E: Looks like the Internet killed the blog site. Basically it's someone saying Amazon killed his friend's account and remotely wiped her Kindle because the account was 'related to an existing closed account', and in the following email chain tells her any future accounts will also be closed and refuses to tell her any further details and ends with "we're not going to discuss the matter further" and "thank you for understanding our decision"
Yeah, I mean it's not like they are playing fair. It's a capitalist system, it pays off to be an opportunist, they take advantages of the system and it's fine. But when your avarage Joe does it, it is wrong?
I also don't like this weird digital-age notion content producers have that they can take back what they sold you. If a copy of a file on your computer is considered an "item" (as they insist it is when pirates "publish" millions of copies), and you've bought it, then it's theft for them to take it back. Imagine if publishers (or recording studios, or movie studios) were allowed to walk into your home and box up your books, movies, and DVDs. I would call the goddamn cops on them, and they would go to jail, because that's theft.
She probably violated some form of terms or contract a person does when registering their product. Rarely happens, except they took action. They may not be informing her of her breach do to reason of pursuing other activity related to her account. Although not fair it's my game plan if I was Amazon. Possible she was taking copywritten material and posting that data elsewhere. Uploading to torrents. Honestly a little extreme.

What wouldn't surprise me is hearing something equivalent from Obama. After 3 thankless years of trying to turn around problems he didn't create, while taking all the blame for it, he's still out there campaigning and trying to do the job again. Fucking amazing that he isn't up there going "Hey Romney it's all yours. Good luck, buddy. I'm going to go sit on a beach and watch the world burn."
He's saying the salesman needs to make more money for his family for when he dies. I mean it's either cars or blue meth.
That's because it's been conveniently left out of the media narrative.
Mitt Romney was born in 1947, meaning he would have been 19 in 1966. Age 19 is exactly in the age range where every male member of the LDS church goes on a mission. It's not "convenient", it's just how LDS missions work.
Former Mormon here, not every 19 year old boy goes on a mission, it's a choice. So he clearly chose to do that while avoiding the draft. There were plenty of men that chose the opposite even though they were Mormon 19 year olds.
The problem isn't just in the federal government as an organism, it's in individual government officials that have no integrity.
Unfortunately, there are enough people out there who take religion seriously enough that it's not very pragmatic to mock them in public.  It's not like you have to fall back on his religion to make Romney look ridiculous, anyway.
I think it's more that the title it's without context rather than being misleading. The title just quotes Romney.  I didn't interpret that to mean he running to make money at all (he's a billionaire for chrissake -- who becomes president for the $$?)
They can't fathom that, there are many people who have conservative parents or upbringing, and yet became liberals because /r/politics is not distorting information, it's linking to well-researched news articles by journalists. In the age of the internet, we can check and verify, the truthfulness of /r/politics, and yet these people are flat out saying "LIBERAL MEDIA"; one person in /r/askreddit, got downvoted for saying 'liberal media myth', and people accused him of liberal bias. Anything that doesn't fit their conservative worldview == liberal bias and thus false!
We're calling them "Low information voters" until the middle of November when it's okay to offend them again.
What I can't figure out -- and I've spoken to a number of teachers about it, and no one knows -- is who actually believes this bullshit.  Someone, somewhere, is making policy that no one can fail, that the tests are unfair, that if the material were just taught differently than every child would be smart.  But I don't know who these people are, or why they believe this way.  Hell, I can't even figure out who decided they should stop keeping score in softball; everyone acknowledges that it's bullshit, but that's just the way it's played now.
To be fair, what about all the black voters that came out in 2008 that never voted a day in their life? I do understand that it's a bit different coming from a minority group. On the other hand, I don't feel like the same voters would come out if it was someone like Herman Cain.
the polls are incredibly inaccurate. take this poll for instance, it's the only poll putting Romney ahead.
It's the same brain washing that keeps kids in at night and teaches them to brush their teeth, so let's not take that thought process TOO far.  It comes down to humans being limited in their abilities.  The spectrum is so wide, so vast that anyone wanting to cast a wide political net must first chose to generalized a possibly misleading message, and every political message needs a boogey-man.  When you look at the messages closely it's clear - Democrats blame the republicans, themselves and the past.  The republicans blame anyone but themselves at all costs, and they almost always blame the opponent as a part of their opening line, and then go on to vaguely offer a solution, to be explained and executed AFTER the republican is placed in office.  I'm not saying the democrats are being honest or informed in their description of the placed blame, but I am saying that when a kid comes up to you and blames everyone in the world but himself for the broken lamp, it's pretty clear what happened. Now in this scenario with a broken lamp, a kid with an excuse, and mom the results are clear, but what if this house is full of a LOT of other kids and some adults, but everyone gets equal votes?  That kid with the explanation of what went wrong simply has to speak more loudly and keep his story on track to convince enough OTHER kids that his story is true.  That is the simple method in which the republicans ensure the race will always be close these days, vague up the message to everyone, relying on how busy and uninformed people HAVE to be thanks to the limitations of humans in a drowning economy, and always blame the other guy no matter what.  The only thing that can bring down this type of play is an informed public, and so far we ain't gettin' that.

But it's totally true.  The money is in Washington.  And every President, Senator and Congressmen participates in the corruption.  Even your grand leader ___ (enter name here) is corrupt.  You want real change you need to understand that almost everything you learn in school is a lie to brainwash you into a system of slavery.  Once you know that to be true you can start re-learning the truths of the world and help wake up others.  The only way to change and be free is to educate everyone in what it means to be free.  Religion and Government are here to control you.  These elections mean nothing.  Whoever you vote for will not change things for the better for you, but only change things for the government by consolidation.  The govenment will get bigger and control more and more and make more laws.  And you will still be a worker.  The education system is here to indoctrinate you into thinking you can't survive without being someone's employee - IE: someones slave.  It's never about you being free to live without needing to be an employee.  You don't get taught to own your own land, farm and grow food for yourself.  It's always about you working for someone else, getting paid money to go to the store to buy their crap that you could have grown yourself.   Learn what Serfdom means.  Obama is for big corporations, war, wallstreet, and bailouts for bankers.  Romney is the same.  Make no mistake they are the same.  They want war and money and they don't give a damn about you.  They never did.  Grow up.

Why are there still monkeys - We didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and monkeys have a common ancestor. Asking why are there still monkeys is like asking if you came from your cousin, why are your cousins still here -- it's nonsensical.
What humans have a problem in accepting, is the concept that the universe contains the physics that create time and space; it's impossible for us to really grasp the concept of something from nothing, or nothingness itself because we've never experienced nothing, or anything that has no external form.  *if you die and are nothing, the brain cannot reconcile that notion to anything its ever experienced; how can something like our conscious mind become nothing?  It's far easier to think that we are transformed into something else which allows our conscious mind to carry on to eternity (whatever that actually means).

If we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?  Um.  Well, I don't believe we did come from monkeys, so this is a moot question.  But assuming that I did not believe, according to my understanding of evolution, it's not so much that people came from monkeys, but rather that they shared a similar ancestor.
Yes I have.  I don't know if it's real or not, but to me and what I believe in, it changes nothing.

Someone incredibly familiar with the IEM here. It has nothing to do with corn futures. The reason it isn't regulated is because traders can only invest $500. Anything more than that and the CFTC would consider them a gambling house. Honestly, it is 100% betting on the election, but it's used for research and they don't make a profit, so the CFTC says it's cool.
On top of that, Nate Silver would seem to justify Reddit's bias.
I'm currently reading Nate Silver's book, and it's fascinating to see all of the different factors that must be aggregated to make these predictions.  Very interesting stuff.
The media likes to emphasize the popular vote because it's a lot closer than the electoral vote. If people think Obama has it all sewn up they might stop watching the circus.
This personalization has a really negative effect on how we are informed as citizens. Just by browsing Reddit, you'll passively reinforce particular existing views - and even radicalize them. Without any content to counter or challenge the things we want to see, Reddit essentially becomes an echo chamber. We hear what we already think because the website is personalized to us, and because we hear it again, we think it's right. This effect is vastly compounded if Reddit is your only source of news. Because there is no overarching content control, there is no pressure to supply the other side(s) to issues.
Every time I've posted something that's portrays Obama, Liz Warren, etc in a negative light (which always comes from a good source) it's not only not upvoted, it's actively downvoted by numerous people.
I would love a more neutral subreddit with stricter rules on fact checking and serious comments (no puns, lame jokes and other meaningless posts), because it's almost as bad as /r/athesim in there.
There is also an age component at play here.  Reddit's demographic skews toward liberalism.  It also skews heavily toward those who are just out of college or just starting out in careers, aren't making any money yet and feel powerless.  Those folks, by and large, aren't voting for Romney.
There was an article that went out last week that researched Romney's remark during the debate about the President's pension. Politifact looked into it and found out Obama's pension is set up through the Cayman islands with investments in China. It's also much larger than Romney's. This isn't necessarily the Presidents fault as it's a blind investment setup through Illinois but highly hypocritical of his administration to criticize Romney for the same thing.
I was hoping it would garner some actual discussion (and vitriol) but apparently the post just got largely ignored. I suspect it  would have been on the top of /r/politics for weeks if it was Romney. Honestly I think /r/politics should have it's name changed.
Except the point about American politics being shifted right still stands when you look globally comparing America to other Western nations. The point about a shift to the left does not exist when you look outside the US. Seems like one side has a bit more support for it's case.
Except it's not a point of view, it's a fact. In the "left" / "right" political spectrum the true far left would be your socialism/communism (and don't forget anarcho-syndicalist-communes, lol). In meaningful use of the political spectrum there's no confusion.
I think it's the vote system that fucks everything up. It's meant to be used to vote discussions to the top, but it's used to vote dissenting opinions out of existence. Downvoting things you don't personally agree with is not what the system is in place for, but that's sure as hell how it's used.
Rather, it's just "Their conditions are different.  Case closed.  The end.".
I've noticed the whole Romney-is-evil thing here as well, but what's more troubling to me about political discourse on Reddit is how conservatives as a whole are treated. Reading comments on r/politics, you'd think that there's absolutely no logical basis for a conservative ideology. Sure, I disagree with most of what the GOP currently stands for, but it's possible to agree with the party and be an intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate person. Reading Reddit, you don't get a sense of any of that.
Maybe, but since the start of the month Obama has the lead in 4 polls compared to Romney's 8. Most of these leads on both sides are within the margin of error, but still I'd say it's more likely to go for Romney.
However, polls always have a margin of error, and even that margin of error is not an absolute indicator due to the confidence margin or whatever the statistical term is. I.e. a poll can have a 4 point margin of error but a 1 in 20 chance of being off the mark anyways, I think it's called a p-value, I never actually had a class on it all.
Well, seeing as a ton of the posts from r/politics are just retarded blogs, and at least 50% of the posts are filled with top comments saying "this article is complete bullshit" with intelligent discussion as to why, and then the second or third top comment is "People need to see this and wake up! This country is being destroyed. We aren't free! Romney will destroy us all!" I think it's safe to say that we are incredibly distorted. Not that others aren't, but if you believe Reddit isn't a source with a huge democratic bias, you probably don't value facts that much when it comes to making up your mind about something.  The truth and lies that a news article is composed of is like a smoothie of propaganda, which is which is only distinguishable if you put in the time to check sources, reliability, and how much facts are stretched.
On the other hand it's very comfy to be around people whom you agree with, and it creates a nice, self-perpetuating bubble of smug arrogance (as in my post). It does not mean it's not true, but it can make yourself feel more important than you really are.
I also think there's an element of arrogance involved as well. In the sense that it's unacceptable to admit something as important as an American Election could be so one-sided and predictable. American pop culture is all about drama, drama, drama; and there's no drama in a predictable outcome.

Hi Mr Roberts! First I want to thank you for doing this AMA and also for being so brave and challenging the industry and it's BS console focused mindset. This project is one that I personally had given up on ever seeing and I believe it will have a massive impact on the future of gaming. I am very excited.
And an advice about translating the game in other languages if I may: Please keep the names of the cities, planets and other stuff in the original language. WoW made that mistake and it's really annoying and confusing with all the different names of the cities for example.
Will we be able to build as well as purchase? I don't mean in the RTS sense, but will we be able to establish our own base of operations, in the sense that it's not a ship, but a stationary base?
Also, IIRC, it's been stated that in engagements, 'slots' will be reserved for your friends to jump in and help. Does this mean it won't be a 'come and go as you please' universe or am I just mistaken, which I probably am. Already gonna buy, but this clarification would just get me all the more titalated. Thanks!
Or are you aiming at some other point in the spectrum?  I watched the S42 trailer many, many times, and the speeds and distances involved look similar to WCP, but I know it's very early stage and still a prototype tech demo.  Just wanted to know if the trailer is representative of the combat pacing you're aiming for.
First off, thank you for doing this AMA and the work you’ve done in the past. My questions focus primarily on some of the less space sim-y aspects of Star Citizen. I apologize if these questions have already been asked, it's hard to keep track of all the information. If you could answer just one or two I’d appreciate it.
This game seems ambitious on a scale we haven't seen before.  MMO/single/super detail/super fast/open ended it seems like it's tackling every angle at once.
-I feel like doing the 5$ = __ credits right away is removing the "I've earned this item because of my skills/time spent ingame". Do you think it's ahred amongst player, and if so, how are you going to solve that?
I was wondering if you were planning to implement TrackIR support. You're a PC man and I'm assuming you've heard of the device. I know it's not mega-popular, but it enahances the immersion in games in a way I can't even describe.
Also, how in-depth will customization go in the game? Will it only be "skin deep" with colors and such? I understand that the ships have a large number of modeled parts for realistic damage, but could we be provided with a modular custom ship creator? Say I save up a massive amount of money, could I build a custom Cruiser with a small landing bay in back for one or two fighters? Maybe there would be a buch of prefabricated rooms, engines, features and armament that I could arrange how I wanted and then give it it's armored skin over top to finish construction. Is this idea possible? Not possible? Why?
The original Wing Commander and it's sequels were hugely influential on my life.  I credit my career in IT directly with the skills and lessons I learned while learning how to make these games run properly on various computers over the years.
I just want to say, you are amazing!!! I am still playing freelancer (discovery mod) since its really the only space sim that gets it right. It has held up amazingly well for being such an old game, and I'm so excited for the improvements you're bringing to Star Citizen. As an engineer, the fly by wire system has me really excited! I absolutely cannot wait to play this game, and I'm even considering buying a dedicated gaming rig just to play it in all it's glory!

You forgot to put words over it. Reddit won't upvote comments like this unless it's a gif or reiterates the message on the picture.
"This guy is right, for once it's not a video or story about a girl being shot or raped, good on us, for once."
As it seems like none of my previous classmates are redditors I feel it's my duty to defend my school against some of the less constructive comments.
This is Witney M. Young high school and it's a magnet school in Chicago. Top 3 in the city, 4th in the state, and around 135 in the nation. It's pretty funny reading a bunch of comments about this "inner city" school, when in fact the majority of the students in that video are probably enrolled in AP classes and will receive offers of enrollment from some of the top universities in the country.
To be fair, it's not really reddit logic. It's the American middle-class suburb logic.
Haha thank you. Although I do provide some evidence in some of my replies to back up the claim that this school is supposed to be good. But I don't see how it's not believable that a video of kids being kids (not really kids) can come from a school with high test scores. No matter where you are, at the ages of 14–18 you're going to do ridiculous things and be rowdy. In fact, you probably know that in these schools no one really causes trouble, so that's why the teachers don't shut it down right away because they know it probably won't get too out of control despite how loud it is. I'm guessing within a minute after the video stopped, some high up faculty walks by, tells them to quiet down, and everyone goes back to being normal.
Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
What makes you think it's from the inner city?
If you serve someone back after getting served, then it's on.
Wait... so high school today really IS like it's portrayed in those stupid dance movies?
Just wait until you see their football games. It's not about football at all, it's just an opportunity for each school's marching band to compete with each other.
Oh it's on.
Oh...it's on!

This is an MRI scan, so it's a cross sectional image.
Exactly. There's no doubt that one is bigger than the other but as far as comparisons go, you can't go in too much details since it's not the same cut.
Correct me if I'm wrong [edit: I am wrong, see /u/Mansy's comment below], but I don't think this isn't an MRI scan. I think it's images taken in a method akin to the Visible Human Project - literally images of frozen cadavers which are photographed cross-sectionally, then a layer is removed (destructively), a new photo taken and so on and so forth.
it's hard to see the plane in which these are taken, but I think those are eyes.
Being fat is unhealthy, same as smoking. We should ultimately respect people's decisions, but I don't see how it's unreasonable to suggest that overweight people lose some weight.
So it's farts.
Jesus the human heart is huge, it's weirding me out man
yeah, I once saw a scan of my chest and all I though was "damn, what the hell is this thing? it's freakin huge!" ... "oh, that's the heart?? :o"
it's all good, You left it on, but you also left the side door open, so I walked in and turned it off.
No, it's more than just that. Look at the muscle development on the interior side of the ankles, and the shape of the ankles themselves. Her disorders are related to more than just being overweight, although i'm sure it's adding additional strain and not improving her situation.
I know jack about MRIs but I'm guessing it's only because of how the MRI take's a 'slice'. It's probably the same reason why the arm bones aren't visible on each women, since they would be angled downwards while laying on a table
It is not healthy that fat people have larger hearts. It's the body's way of adapting to needing to supply more blood. When the heart does this, it is prone to heart-attacks and cardiovascular diseases. Being obese puts tremendous strain on the heart, so no, it's not healthy.
See, it's not bullying.
Yes, it's visceral fat (fat that surrounds the organs). It's very unhealthy to have a significant amount of visceral fat because your body faces a huge risk in heart problems, diabetes and various other health issues.
If it's a CT scan, dark areas are less dense.  You can usually tell if a person has gas by a black area in the stomach.  (disclaimer: I am not a radiologist).  If dark area was shit, then this person inhaled a ton of it into her lungs.
If it's a CT scan ... I suck at reading MRI's though.
No, it's just air. Unfortunately, you won't be able to say "Fat girls are full of shit, I've seen it!"
yeah, i have the same problem getting through doorways as well. not because i'm so large (since i'm 1% bodyfat) but because my dick is 36 inches long and always erect. it's very hard traversing through tight knit indoor environments and sharp turns when you have that much sway and inertia in your lower body.

Gaga has a pretty great voice, it's just not as unique as Adele's-
I think the music biz really is like this. Some guy thought that the "lady gaga" marketing campaign is what was needed. Was it? Would more people have liked her original image? No one can truly say. I think that the perception of the gatekeeper has much more to do with what is inflicted upon us than the reality of what people really like. I mean, it's not as if Adele needed to be marketed as Princess Delly or something with backup dancers in tow.
Yeah, except the whole child prodigy thing. I'm not a fan of her or her music but she apparently has some serious chops. Also pop music is meant to be superficial and vapid. Consequently it's also designed to make a lot of money as well. During every part of modern music there are people that hear whatever is popular and decry how it's leading to the decay of society. It's just not true. Jazz and Rock n' Roll were supposed to lead to the doom of the world, but that never happened. Basically you just shouldn't make sweeping generalizations like that based on the like 2 songs you heard from her.
As a competent guitar player, I'm at the point where I don't like certain players because of the knowledge that being a musician imparts to me. For me one of these players is Slash. As a rock band, G'n'R is pretty great, but I can't just listen to them without analyzing Slash's playing. It sounds good, but it's not great in the guitar realm. When my relatives found out I was a guitar player they all seemed to jump on the "play me Sweet Child" bandwagon but when I explained that I didn't know it because I didn't like Slash, their response was akin to "shut up, he's famous and you're not, so he's done something right."
Meanwhile I was studying SRV, BB King, Townshend, and Hendrix who are arguably more important to rock than Slash. Can you see the disconnect here? It's not even a matter of talent unless the "victim" (for lack of a better word) is going around saying how much better they are than x or y; it's usually a matter of taste.
Let's be honest...lyrically and musically speaking it's all been done before and pretty much half the insane bullshit she does was done by Madonna before her.
oh hey look it's a normal hot person
Oh ok so because you like Bowies music more, so it's ok for him to act weird
the reason she became famous was because of her standing out. She HAD to stand out against the competition, otherwise no one would hear her, she was just another "aspiring" musician. Now, she's a somebody. She has a name. She can be normal if she wants to, but I think she enjoys being OTT, she knows it's working, she makes the headlines with every new outfit she comes up with. Plus, it must be fantastic to be a celebrity and have NO ONE recodnise you out of your "image" :)

...With Reddit's ability to hit on anyone as soon as they find out someone's a woman?
I definitely understand where you're coming from and I appreciate the sentiment. I just feel sad when I look at myself and don't see what I would like. I've gotten over any embarrassment with regards to what others think. I'd really like to just be happy with what I have, and most of the time it's not on my mind at all, but if I'm being honest I'd love to fill in shirts and dresses better, not bust out of them, but just fit properly so they aren't hanging off of me. I hate clothes shopping and that's a big part of why, nothing is really designed for flat girls. Not in my income range anyway.
it's ok. small chested girls make me have a sad too.
It's probably because for her, it's about what she likes, not about what you do.
I don't think it's what she likes.  I think it's what she thinks that the world likes.
That's not a good thing. It's like saying, "Your breasts are so small, it's just like you had breast cancer and got them removed!"
Next time my girlfriend complains about her boobs I'll let her know that it's OK, at least she can wear suspenders.
Not that it's really the same thing but that's like telling a fat person "don't worry there's a ton of people who have fat fetishes!"
Obviously having small boobs is commonly more preferred than being fat but it's still not a super conforming sentiment.
Yeah, the way I see it.......okay, it's nice that you and others like small boobs, that people find them attractive. But I don't. And I'm the one who has to live with 'em.
Definitely still need a sports bra - though you're right that it's probably no where near as uncomfortable. They still bounce a little bit.
Not that I play golf but I've heard that it's also easier with small breasts.

It seems like it's always 8/10
It's not really that we have a monopoly on Reddit's advertising system, it's just that there are not a lot of advertisers on Reddit in general. We actually pay the minimum amount required per day to advertise ($30 per subreddit), and are usually competing with a few different ads each day. Redditors love the site, the 5K+ upvotes and comments are all legit (as krispykrackers confirmed above), and this ad brings us a ton of new visitors, so it's worthwhile for us to keep this ad running every day.
It's because it's the same thread being promoted, those are the same comments you see everytime.

"Apelsin - Kolsyrad läskedryck" Basically means that it's orange flavored carbonated soda.
Not that anyone would likely crack it open and drink it... but if it's been in storage for roughly as long as it is old without severe agitation, all the syrup and additives have come out of suspension... the top part is all carbonated water, and the lower part is all syrup and coloring.
I cracked a Pepsi from dad's cupboard and realized that the soda was bland-- thought, "oh... it's just caffeine free... and flavor free."  So I poured it in the sink and it came out clear followed by brown sludge.
There is a protective liner along the inside of the can, protecting the metal from the liquid, however it is easily punctured, particularly if the can has ever been dented (either by you or somewhere along the process shipping from the factory to the store). Once that happens, it's not a question of if but when it will begin to leak everywhere and destroy everything you hold dear.

Your park rating will drop, but it's oh so fun.
It was one of those deals where they released almost the exact same game but with a few minor changes and called it '2'. There are new rides and things, it's more or less an expansion park.
The only really notable difference is that you could stack scenery. In the first one you could only build little walls on the grass, but once you are able to stack scenery, you can work upward too, so it allowed you to build little houses and things, with roofs and that. This made little difference to the game, but once the modding community got hold of it, they made their own scenery, and used this new stacking ability to make incredibly complex structures and things. Just take a look at the links I provided, it's amazing, but still so time consuming; each piece on each square is placed by hand.
But you're forgetting it's called Universe Sandbox.

That's what reddit's for.
Actually, it's >7 billion now.
Every 150 minutes there is 1 year of video uploaded, that is INCREDIBLE. My mind is blown just trying to comprehend consuming that much content and it's uploaded EVERY 150 minutes!
Reddit isn't useful to me because it's a link aggregator or a forum. It's useful because it's a scalable and universal system for screening content, from videos to products to music or fashion. Google has spent the last few years trying to tackle "social search." Reddit ended up doing by accident.
With inflation it's more like over 9.86 based on this huffpost article.
The problem that drives reposts isn't a lack of content - it's a lack of good content, and good ways to separate the good from the bad. The reason we get reposts is that they've already gotten past the "is this good or bad?" filter, and so can be depended on. If good content is a needle in a stack of shit, then reposts are all those needles that have been painstakingly grabbed from the shit and already set aside.
If you filter out videos of cats and crap lets plays, it's about 30 minutes.
This is strongly in line with the lifestyle of it's founder and CEO, Tristam Shandy.

Ya know sometimes, as a parent, it's just better to let your kid not eat their peas and green beans if they don't want to.
Because parents are supposed to be proud when their children kill or die for their country, not when they speak up when it's illegal or may offend people.
the speaking up I can deal with it's their right as humans to do so, the breaking and entering, destruction of property and assault I cannot.
It's an acceptable form of justice as far as I'm concerned since it's not changing the law it's just bending it so it doesn't create any dangerous precedents (i.e. they would of been charged with what they were charged with regardless but likely wouldn't of gotten anywhere near the max sentence if it wasn't for all this other stuff I'm guessing).
No. Tolokonnikova was one of the founders and leaders, not simply a member. Samutsevich was one of the other members of Voina as you can see from their video and photo reports. As for other two pussy riot members (one of which wasn't caught), it's not clear at all, since neither group has listed their membership for their own safety sake.
Because it's a horrible travesty to the values of the civilized and democratic world, which Russia half-heartedly pretends to be a part of.
I was born in the Soviet Union, and I guess it's clear why the West abandoned us after World War 2.
They're not progressive. They have never fought for anything in their lives. They're a typical US shopper/worker with a cozy priviliged life. In a bubble like that it's difficult to understand.
You're right, but as I said a few times now, it's almost guaranteed that their previous criminal history comes into consideration when a sentence is being handed down hence the 2 years they received.
Fun fact: there's a purposefully funny Russian dub of the Lord of the Rings, and Mordor becomes Mordovia, Gondor becomes Honduras, etc. In Russian it's hilarious.
I'm glad to have more facts, glad to have read the article. But I found it grating that the author emphasized what the facilities used to be used for by a different government. I get the symbolism here. The right way to handle this is to point out the symbolism and then report accurately about the current conditions at these facilities. Propaganda bothers me, even when it's for "my side."
This may be true, but to put bullshit quoted by them in the headline in such a way will make it seem like it's the truth.  Such a line should be in the article, and it should be followed with a debunking, but it shouldn't be the headline, as that will mislead people and the media knows this.
... but it's for their "singing", and not their activism, so it's completely justified.
that raises the question about the legitimacy of the protest, not the power => it's counterproductive

Interesting other issue are bats are coming down with the white nose syndrome (fungus) which is killing them off. They eat insects, and it's entirely possible that not only are we killing insects but in turn we are killing the animals that eat insects, too.
Maybe it's just me but I never really understood why people thought it was a great idea to spray poison all over and why they are surprised when it kills things. I mean, it doesn't take "human poison" to kill me - could be rat poison, could be weed poison, could be bug poison. Likewise with other life forms.
That's not what I meant, I guess I was unclear. What I meant is that it's unsurprising to me that pesticide and herbicide causes massive "collateral damage" to bees, seeing as how pesticide and herbicide at those levels would cause the same damage to most animals.
Sorry, I guess my comment was unclear. What I mean is that since obviously we spend some effort checking crops to make sure that the very small levels of residual pesticide/herbicide do not harm humans, it's utterly unsurprising that much higher levels of pesticide and herbicide harm bees.
Those insects become resistant to that pesticide (or it's found to be too toxic) and they stop it's use, and use something else.  And the cycle repeats.
someone finds a new article, or a new article finds old research.  And every time informed people groan because it's fairly well established as a bunch of causes, and pesticides aren't necessarily even a top one.
This research is important and novel because it's replicating field-level exposures on bumblebee colonies of two pesticides (a neonicitinoid and a pyrethroid) in combination as well as individually, this hasn't been done before.
Heck it's one of the reasons GM foods are so important. Because the current nuke spray effect of pesticides is far more harmful then the controlled levels plants naturally produce, and if we can replicate nature, it'll probably be better for everyone.
I don't think news articles paint the picture right.  There's company involvement all over the place, but most farms, in the states I have lived in, are actually owned and operated by farmers, then they give their crops to a pool/company that distributes.  If a company owns a farm, it's a company started by the family that started the farm.  I have two grandmothers that own a substantial amount of family farms, which act as their retirement income.  The farm is still mostly operated by family members though.
So since Agent Orange is a defoliant it's safe to eat.

http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/11vz4g/amazon_closes_womans_account_and_wipes_her_kindle/
According to this interview with Linn, it appears that she bought her first Kindle used,  so it's not entirely inconceivable that it's related to the account tied to the previous owner of that Kindle.
I should add that in addition to emailing, I did call, several times. While it's hard to say if it helped, it was definitely more helpful than emailing.
I only got back a really surley fuck you type message. So then I inquired again politely and got the same shitty response back. Took the gloves off and, without any actual threats, etc mind you, just a bit of a tyraid on how they could treat their customers this way it's not right, etc etc, some tech emails me back saying I'm being threatening and has called the cops on me.
Amazon is now going to release a statement explaining what happened, and it's going to turn out that this woman's Credit Card information has been used in multiple other accounts and Amazon was basically just shutting down all the accounts so that card can't be used anymore on their site.
THAT SAID, how Amazon's handling this is bullshit and they should absolutely be providing her with enough information to know exactly what's going on.  Plus, of course, it's rather troubling to think that your Kindle and everything you purchased for it could be wiped out entirely at the whim of Amazon, with no recourse besides legal action.
Either way, while I'm not saying it's impossible this is 100% an error on Amazon's part, I'm still guessing there's more to the story on the customer's end than we're hearing.
I had a similar problem with Amazon, I think for them it's par for the course to not provide any details why they close an account. I tried calling them a few times - at one time one of the customer reps said that there was no problem with my account, but with an account from a customer in another city who has the same name as I do. (Fine, I have an relatively unusual name, but not that unusual. And really - the credit card details say where I live, so why is that an issue?)
In my experience it's fairly typical for large companies not to provide details in cases which are related to some kind of account fraud or related abuse. The more details they make available, the more vulnerable their detection tech is to gaming by scammers.
It's pretty baffling all around, so don't think I'm defending Amazon TOO much here.  I'm just saying, it's still safe to assume that companies have a purpose to their actions, at least most of the time.
With that said, this post is disturbing.  Regardless of whether she did or didn't do something wrong, or Amazon simply made a mistake, it's not good that we're headed in a direction where large corporations "own" what you "buy" and have the ability to repossess or destroy it with no explanation, no due process and no viable recourse.
I'm sure I've used terms like "purchased" to describe digital media before. I just wanted to use this opportunity to point out the distinction to people who might not otherwise know about it, because it's very relevant to the discussion at hand.
That's probably the most sensible idea. If she lost enough to be worth her time then she should at least contact the amazon legal department and say if it's not sorted out then she will take legal action.
See, the problem is, when I see Amazon could suspend my account by mistake and deny me access to the stuff I bought from them, not tell me why or otherwise try to help fix the mistake, and my only recourse would be to get a lawyer and perhaps go to court, as a potential customer it just doesn't make me want to do business with them. It's too risky and complicated. And it's their loss more than it is mine.
Digital media with restrictions like this should be treated for what they are: rentals. As such, they are only deserving of a rental's price. This is why I never spend more than $10 for a Steam game, or $1-2 for an eBook. If it's not mine, then it's still the seller's, in which case they don't deserve full price for it.
Interestingly enough, only Apple has thus far actually moved to a model embracing technology's strengths without the inane restrictions, but even there it's only with music (and still limited to lossy formats).
This. Also, it's not Amazon deciding on whether an e-book should have DRM or not, it's the publishers. Amazon's actually been fighting a huge legal battle against the publishers, in behalf of their customers to prevent the fucked-up pricing that's been happening (e-books costing as much, and sometimes more than the hard cover version).
The point here isn't who caused the problem, the point here is that Amazon isn't even trying to help this customer fix it. The worst part, for me, is where they stated that "any subsequent account" would be closed as well. What the actual fuck? This is essentially banning the person altogether. I don't think it's wrong to terminate the account of someone who broke the rules, but to keep terminating any new accounts after they've learned a lesson? That's just mean and hostile. And especially so if you refuse to tell the person why you banned them to begin with.
It's shitty, but well within the terms of service, and it's something people should be aware of before they tie so much of their life/purchases to an account that could be closed on a whim.
The problem is when problems occur which the customer service agent in India isn't capable of solving.  This is when you see the beautiful surface of Amazon peel away and what's left is a rotten core of cold heartless automation, the Hades of customer service.  By definition you will get absolutely no assistance here because it's completely devoid of human thought or compassion; again, Amazon is built to ignore the most time consuming customers.  They don't want you, and thus your complaints will be met with mindless form emails until you give up and leave.  Amazon: 1, Annoying Customer: 0.
Believe it or not, I still shop at Amazon because their shopping system is far and away the best.  And if something goes wrong I'm sure I can usually get a decent remedy.  But I have no illusions about the way the company works behind the scenes.  I hope nobody here personally has to deal with Amazon on the same level I did, because it's hell.
No, but it's how many businesses behave as soon as there is the slightest whiff of something that interests the "security" department.
It's usually an issue of some dipshit who loves the power they have to close accounts and goes overboard in assuming somethings bad or fishy when it's not. Once these folks close accounts, it usually took someone higher up like me to MAKE them understand they did a bad thing and open the account back up. Even then, they would smirk and say they weren't wrong. It was absurd.
E: Looks like the Internet killed the blog site. Basically it's someone saying Amazon killed his friend's account and remotely wiped her Kindle because the account was 'related to an existing closed account', and in the following email chain tells her any future accounts will also be closed and refuses to tell her any further details and ends with "we're not going to discuss the matter further" and "thank you for understanding our decision"
Yeah, I mean it's not like they are playing fair. It's a capitalist system, it pays off to be an opportunist, they take advantages of the system and it's fine. But when your avarage Joe does it, it is wrong?
I also don't like this weird digital-age notion content producers have that they can take back what they sold you. If a copy of a file on your computer is considered an "item" (as they insist it is when pirates "publish" millions of copies), and you've bought it, then it's theft for them to take it back. Imagine if publishers (or recording studios, or movie studios) were allowed to walk into your home and box up your books, movies, and DVDs. I would call the goddamn cops on them, and they would go to jail, because that's theft.
She probably violated some form of terms or contract a person does when registering their product. Rarely happens, except they took action. They may not be informing her of her breach do to reason of pursuing other activity related to her account. Although not fair it's my game plan if I was Amazon. Possible she was taking copywritten material and posting that data elsewhere. Uploading to torrents. Honestly a little extreme.

What wouldn't surprise me is hearing something equivalent from Obama. After 3 thankless years of trying to turn around problems he didn't create, while taking all the blame for it, he's still out there campaigning and trying to do the job again. Fucking amazing that he isn't up there going "Hey Romney it's all yours. Good luck, buddy. I'm going to go sit on a beach and watch the world burn."
He's saying the salesman needs to make more money for his family for when he dies. I mean it's either cars or blue meth.
That's because it's been conveniently left out of the media narrative.
Mitt Romney was born in 1947, meaning he would have been 19 in 1966. Age 19 is exactly in the age range where every male member of the LDS church goes on a mission. It's not "convenient", it's just how LDS missions work.
Former Mormon here, not every 19 year old boy goes on a mission, it's a choice. So he clearly chose to do that while avoiding the draft. There were plenty of men that chose the opposite even though they were Mormon 19 year olds.
The problem isn't just in the federal government as an organism, it's in individual government officials that have no integrity.
Unfortunately, there are enough people out there who take religion seriously enough that it's not very pragmatic to mock them in public.  It's not like you have to fall back on his religion to make Romney look ridiculous, anyway.
I think it's more that the title it's without context rather than being misleading. The title just quotes Romney.  I didn't interpret that to mean he running to make money at all (he's a billionaire for chrissake -- who becomes president for the $$?)
They can't fathom that, there are many people who have conservative parents or upbringing, and yet became liberals because /r/politics is not distorting information, it's linking to well-researched news articles by journalists. In the age of the internet, we can check and verify, the truthfulness of /r/politics, and yet these people are flat out saying "LIBERAL MEDIA"; one person in /r/askreddit, got downvoted for saying 'liberal media myth', and people accused him of liberal bias. Anything that doesn't fit their conservative worldview == liberal bias and thus false!
We're calling them "Low information voters" until the middle of November when it's okay to offend them again.
What I can't figure out -- and I've spoken to a number of teachers about it, and no one knows -- is who actually believes this bullshit.  Someone, somewhere, is making policy that no one can fail, that the tests are unfair, that if the material were just taught differently than every child would be smart.  But I don't know who these people are, or why they believe this way.  Hell, I can't even figure out who decided they should stop keeping score in softball; everyone acknowledges that it's bullshit, but that's just the way it's played now.
To be fair, what about all the black voters that came out in 2008 that never voted a day in their life? I do understand that it's a bit different coming from a minority group. On the other hand, I don't feel like the same voters would come out if it was someone like Herman Cain.
the polls are incredibly inaccurate. take this poll for instance, it's the only poll putting Romney ahead.
It's the same brain washing that keeps kids in at night and teaches them to brush their teeth, so let's not take that thought process TOO far.  It comes down to humans being limited in their abilities.  The spectrum is so wide, so vast that anyone wanting to cast a wide political net must first chose to generalized a possibly misleading message, and every political message needs a boogey-man.  When you look at the messages closely it's clear - Democrats blame the republicans, themselves and the past.  The republicans blame anyone but themselves at all costs, and they almost always blame the opponent as a part of their opening line, and then go on to vaguely offer a solution, to be explained and executed AFTER the republican is placed in office.  I'm not saying the democrats are being honest or informed in their description of the placed blame, but I am saying that when a kid comes up to you and blames everyone in the world but himself for the broken lamp, it's pretty clear what happened. Now in this scenario with a broken lamp, a kid with an excuse, and mom the results are clear, but what if this house is full of a LOT of other kids and some adults, but everyone gets equal votes?  That kid with the explanation of what went wrong simply has to speak more loudly and keep his story on track to convince enough OTHER kids that his story is true.  That is the simple method in which the republicans ensure the race will always be close these days, vague up the message to everyone, relying on how busy and uninformed people HAVE to be thanks to the limitations of humans in a drowning economy, and always blame the other guy no matter what.  The only thing that can bring down this type of play is an informed public, and so far we ain't gettin' that.
romnesia at it's finest

But it's totally true.  The money is in Washington.  And every President, Senator and Congressmen participates in the corruption.  Even your grand leader ___ (enter name here) is corrupt.  You want real change you need to understand that almost everything you learn in school is a lie to brainwash you into a system of slavery.  Once you know that to be true you can start re-learning the truths of the world and help wake up others.  The only way to change and be free is to educate everyone in what it means to be free.  Religion and Government are here to control you.  These elections mean nothing.  Whoever you vote for will not change things for the better for you, but only change things for the government by consolidation.  The govenment will get bigger and control more and more and make more laws.  And you will still be a worker.  The education system is here to indoctrinate you into thinking you can't survive without being someone's employee - IE: someones slave.  It's never about you being free to live without needing to be an employee.  You don't get taught to own your own land, farm and grow food for yourself.  It's always about you working for someone else, getting paid money to go to the store to buy their crap that you could have grown yourself.   Learn what Serfdom means.  Obama is for big corporations, war, wallstreet, and bailouts for bankers.  Romney is the same.  Make no mistake they are the same.  They want war and money and they don't give a damn about you.  They never did.  Grow up.
Gosh, it's almost like he's a Machiavellian, lying sack of shit.

Even the guy who came up with this argument has apologized and recanted it once he learned how bananas were cultivated to how they are today. So it's doubly stupid to use it. Of course, I'm 90% sure this thing is satire anyway.

Why are there still monkeys - We didn't evolve from monkeys. Humans and monkeys have a common ancestor. Asking why are there still monkeys is like asking if you came from your cousin, why are your cousins still here -- it's nonsensical.
What humans have a problem in accepting, is the concept that the universe contains the physics that create time and space; it's impossible for us to really grasp the concept of something from nothing, or nothingness itself because we've never experienced nothing, or anything that has no external form.  *if you die and are nothing, the brain cannot reconcile that notion to anything its ever experienced; how can something like our conscious mind become nothing?  It's far easier to think that we are transformed into something else which allows our conscious mind to carry on to eternity (whatever that actually means).
{...}Grand Canyon form? the force of Colorado river. Ever been there? you should, it's an amazing place.
Isn't it awful how that christian who wrote the thing equates homosexuality and pornography to murder and rape? Those are so unrelated it's not even funny, but obviously to a christian homosexuality or self pleasure is so reprehensible it's up there with violence. I would never equate violence (such as rape and murder) to love (be it hetero, homo, or solo)
I think you have it; it's pretty weak.  Look through the blog.  Seems to be Christian baiting.
Why does my cock fit into my hand so nicely if it's a sin to masturbate?
Grand Canyon form" the force of Colorado river. Ever been there? you should, it's an amazing place.
For what it's worth, I'm a Christian, and I'll give my two cents if anyone would be interested.  (if not, downvote oblivion here i come!)
If we came from monkeys, why are there still monkeys?  Um.  Well, I don't believe we did come from monkeys, so this is a moot question.  But assuming that I did not believe, according to my understanding of evolution, it's not so much that people came from monkeys, but rather that they shared a similar ancestor.
Yes I have.  I don't know if it's real or not, but to me and what I believe in, it changes nothing.

Someone incredibly familiar with the IEM here. It has nothing to do with corn futures. The reason it isn't regulated is because traders can only invest $500. Anything more than that and the CFTC would consider them a gambling house. Honestly, it is 100% betting on the election, but it's used for research and they don't make a profit, so the CFTC says it's cool.
On top of that, Nate Silver would seem to justify Reddit's bias.
I'm currently reading Nate Silver's book, and it's fascinating to see all of the different factors that must be aggregated to make these predictions.  Very interesting stuff.
The media likes to emphasize the popular vote because it's a lot closer than the electoral vote. If people think Obama has it all sewn up they might stop watching the circus.
This personalization has a really negative effect on how we are informed as citizens. Just by browsing Reddit, you'll passively reinforce particular existing views - and even radicalize them. Without any content to counter or challenge the things we want to see, Reddit essentially becomes an echo chamber. We hear what we already think because the website is personalized to us, and because we hear it again, we think it's right. This effect is vastly compounded if Reddit is your only source of news. Because there is no overarching content control, there is no pressure to supply the other side(s) to issues.
Every time I've posted something that's portrays Obama, Liz Warren, etc in a negative light (which always comes from a good source) it's not only not upvoted, it's actively downvoted by numerous people.
I would love a more neutral subreddit with stricter rules on fact checking and serious comments (no puns, lame jokes and other meaningless posts), because it's almost as bad as /r/athesim in there.
There is also an age component at play here.  Reddit's demographic skews toward liberalism.  It also skews heavily toward those who are just out of college or just starting out in careers, aren't making any money yet and feel powerless.  Those folks, by and large, aren't voting for Romney.
There was an article that went out last week that researched Romney's remark during the debate about the President's pension. Politifact looked into it and found out Obama's pension is set up through the Cayman islands with investments in China. It's also much larger than Romney's. This isn't necessarily the Presidents fault as it's a blind investment setup through Illinois but highly hypocritical of his administration to criticize Romney for the same thing.
I was hoping it would garner some actual discussion (and vitriol) but apparently the post just got largely ignored. I suspect it  would have been on the top of /r/politics for weeks if it was Romney. Honestly I think /r/politics should have it's name changed.
Except the point about American politics being shifted right still stands when you look globally comparing America to other Western nations. The point about a shift to the left does not exist when you look outside the US. Seems like one side has a bit more support for it's case.
Except it's not a point of view, it's a fact. In the "left" / "right" political spectrum the true far left would be your socialism/communism (and don't forget anarcho-syndicalist-communes, lol). In meaningful use of the political spectrum there's no confusion.
I think it's the vote system that fucks everything up. It's meant to be used to vote discussions to the top, but it's used to vote dissenting opinions out of existence. Downvoting things you don't personally agree with is not what the system is in place for, but that's sure as hell how it's used.
Rather, it's just "Their conditions are different.  Case closed.  The end.".
I've noticed the whole Romney-is-evil thing here as well, but what's more troubling to me about political discourse on Reddit is how conservatives as a whole are treated. Reading comments on r/politics, you'd think that there's absolutely no logical basis for a conservative ideology. Sure, I disagree with most of what the GOP currently stands for, but it's possible to agree with the party and be an intelligent, thoughtful, compassionate person. Reading Reddit, you don't get a sense of any of that.
Maybe, but since the start of the month Obama has the lead in 4 polls compared to Romney's 8. Most of these leads on both sides are within the margin of error, but still I'd say it's more likely to go for Romney.
However, polls always have a margin of error, and even that margin of error is not an absolute indicator due to the confidence margin or whatever the statistical term is. I.e. a poll can have a 4 point margin of error but a 1 in 20 chance of being off the mark anyways, I think it's called a p-value, I never actually had a class on it all.
Well, seeing as a ton of the posts from r/politics are just retarded blogs, and at least 50% of the posts are filled with top comments saying "this article is complete bullshit" with intelligent discussion as to why, and then the second or third top comment is "People need to see this and wake up! This country is being destroyed. We aren't free! Romney will destroy us all!" I think it's safe to say that we are incredibly distorted. Not that others aren't, but if you believe Reddit isn't a source with a huge democratic bias, you probably don't value facts that much when it comes to making up your mind about something.  The truth and lies that a news article is composed of is like a smoothie of propaganda, which is which is only distinguishable if you put in the time to check sources, reliability, and how much facts are stretched.
On the other hand it's very comfy to be around people whom you agree with, and it creates a nice, self-perpetuating bubble of smug arrogance (as in my post). It does not mean it's not true, but it can make yourself feel more important than you really are.
I also think there's an element of arrogance involved as well. In the sense that it's unacceptable to admit something as important as an American Election could be so one-sided and predictable. American pop culture is all about drama, drama, drama; and there's no drama in a predictable outcome.

Hi Mr Roberts! First I want to thank you for doing this AMA and also for being so brave and challenging the industry and it's BS console focused mindset. This project is one that I personally had given up on ever seeing and I believe it will have a massive impact on the future of gaming. I am very excited.
And an advice about translating the game in other languages if I may: Please keep the names of the cities, planets and other stuff in the original language. WoW made that mistake and it's really annoying and confusing with all the different names of the cities for example.
Will we be able to build as well as purchase? I don't mean in the RTS sense, but will we be able to establish our own base of operations, in the sense that it's not a ship, but a stationary base?
Also, IIRC, it's been stated that in engagements, 'slots' will be reserved for your friends to jump in and help. Does this mean it won't be a 'come and go as you please' universe or am I just mistaken, which I probably am. Already gonna buy, but this clarification would just get me all the more titalated. Thanks!
Or are you aiming at some other point in the spectrum?  I watched the S42 trailer many, many times, and the speeds and distances involved look similar to WCP, but I know it's very early stage and still a prototype tech demo.  Just wanted to know if the trailer is representative of the combat pacing you're aiming for.
First off, thank you for doing this AMA and the work you’ve done in the past. My questions focus primarily on some of the less space sim-y aspects of Star Citizen. I apologize if these questions have already been asked, it's hard to keep track of all the information. If you could answer just one or two I’d appreciate it.
This game seems ambitious on a scale we haven't seen before.  MMO/single/super detail/super fast/open ended it seems like it's tackling every angle at once.
-I feel like doing the 5$ = __ credits right away is removing the "I've earned this item because of my skills/time spent ingame". Do you think it's ahred amongst player, and if so, how are you going to solve that?
I was wondering if you were planning to implement TrackIR support. You're a PC man and I'm assuming you've heard of the device. I know it's not mega-popular, but it enahances the immersion in games in a way I can't even describe.
Also, how in-depth will customization go in the game? Will it only be "skin deep" with colors and such? I understand that the ships have a large number of modeled parts for realistic damage, but could we be provided with a modular custom ship creator? Say I save up a massive amount of money, could I build a custom Cruiser with a small landing bay in back for one or two fighters? Maybe there would be a buch of prefabricated rooms, engines, features and armament that I could arrange how I wanted and then give it it's armored skin over top to finish construction. Is this idea possible? Not possible? Why?
The original Wing Commander and it's sequels were hugely influential on my life.  I credit my career in IT directly with the skills and lessons I learned while learning how to make these games run properly on various computers over the years.
I just want to say, you are amazing!!! I am still playing freelancer (discovery mod) since its really the only space sim that gets it right. It has held up amazingly well for being such an old game, and I'm so excited for the improvements you're bringing to Star Citizen. As an engineer, the fly by wire system has me really excited! I absolutely cannot wait to play this game, and I'm even considering buying a dedicated gaming rig just to play it in all it's glory!

You forgot to put words over it. Reddit won't upvote comments like this unless it's a gif or reiterates the message on the picture.
"This guy is right, for once it's not a video or story about a girl being shot or raped, good on us, for once."
As it seems like none of my previous classmates are redditors I feel it's my duty to defend my school against some of the less constructive comments.
This is Witney M. Young high school and it's a magnet school in Chicago. Top 3 in the city, 4th in the state, and around 135 in the nation. It's pretty funny reading a bunch of comments about this "inner city" school, when in fact the majority of the students in that video are probably enrolled in AP classes and will receive offers of enrollment from some of the top universities in the country.
To be fair, it's not really reddit logic. It's the American middle-class suburb logic.
Haha thank you. Although I do provide some evidence in some of my replies to back up the claim that this school is supposed to be good. But I don't see how it's not believable that a video of kids being kids (not really kids) can come from a school with high test scores. No matter where you are, at the ages of 14–18 you're going to do ridiculous things and be rowdy. In fact, you probably know that in these schools no one really causes trouble, so that's why the teachers don't shut it down right away because they know it probably won't get too out of control despite how loud it is. I'm guessing within a minute after the video stopped, some high up faculty walks by, tells them to quiet down, and everyone goes back to being normal.
Mrs. Marsh? Hi, it's Chef. Yeah, I'm good. Listen: Stan and his friends just got served. Yeah. Yeah, over at the True Value. No no, he's fine. They're all fine. Yeah, it was some kids from out of town. Apparently they were pretty good dancers. They really let 'em have it.
What makes you think it's from the inner city?
If you serve someone back after getting served, then it's on.
Wait... so high school today really IS like it's portrayed in those stupid dance movies?
Just wait until you see their football games. It's not about football at all, it's just an opportunity for each school's marching band to compete with each other.
Oh it's on.
Oh...it's on!
but now it's on....

This is an MRI scan, so it's a cross sectional image.
Exactly. There's no doubt that one is bigger than the other but as far as comparisons go, you can't go in too much details since it's not the same cut.
Correct me if I'm wrong [edit: I am wrong, see /u/Mansy's comment below], but I don't think this isn't an MRI scan. I think it's images taken in a method akin to the Visible Human Project - literally images of frozen cadavers which are photographed cross-sectionally, then a layer is removed (destructively), a new photo taken and so on and so forth.
it's hard to see the plane in which these are taken, but I think those are eyes.
Being fat is unhealthy, same as smoking. We should ultimately respect people's decisions, but I don't see how it's unreasonable to suggest that overweight people lose some weight.
So it's farts.
Jesus the human heart is huge, it's weirding me out man
yeah, I once saw a scan of my chest and all I though was "damn, what the hell is this thing? it's freakin huge!" ... "oh, that's the heart?? :o"
it's all good, You left it on, but you also left the side door open, so I walked in and turned it off.
No, it's more than just that. Look at the muscle development on the interior side of the ankles, and the shape of the ankles themselves. Her disorders are related to more than just being overweight, although i'm sure it's adding additional strain and not improving her situation.
I know jack about MRIs but I'm guessing it's only because of how the MRI take's a 'slice'. It's probably the same reason why the arm bones aren't visible on each women, since they would be angled downwards while laying on a table
It is not healthy that fat people have larger hearts. It's the body's way of adapting to needing to supply more blood. When the heart does this, it is prone to heart-attacks and cardiovascular diseases. Being obese puts tremendous strain on the heart, so no, it's not healthy.
See, it's not bullying.
Yes, it's visceral fat (fat that surrounds the organs). It's very unhealthy to have a significant amount of visceral fat because your body faces a huge risk in heart problems, diabetes and various other health issues.
If it's a CT scan, dark areas are less dense.  You can usually tell if a person has gas by a black area in the stomach.  (disclaimer: I am not a radiologist).  If dark area was shit, then this person inhaled a ton of it into her lungs.
If it's a CT scan ... I suck at reading MRI's though.
No, it's just air. Unfortunately, you won't be able to say "Fat girls are full of shit, I've seen it!"
yeah, i have the same problem getting through doorways as well. not because i'm so large (since i'm 1% bodyfat) but because my dick is 36 inches long and always erect. it's very hard traversing through tight knit indoor environments and sharp turns when you have that much sway and inertia in your lower body.

Gaga has a pretty great voice, it's just not as unique as Adele's-
I think the music biz really is like this. Some guy thought that the "lady gaga" marketing campaign is what was needed. Was it? Would more people have liked her original image? No one can truly say. I think that the perception of the gatekeeper has much more to do with what is inflicted upon us than the reality of what people really like. I mean, it's not as if Adele needed to be marketed as Princess Delly or something with backup dancers in tow.
Yeah, except the whole child prodigy thing. I'm not a fan of her or her music but she apparently has some serious chops. Also pop music is meant to be superficial and vapid. Consequently it's also designed to make a lot of money as well. During every part of modern music there are people that hear whatever is popular and decry how it's leading to the decay of society. It's just not true. Jazz and Rock n' Roll were supposed to lead to the doom of the world, but that never happened. Basically you just shouldn't make sweeping generalizations like that based on the like 2 songs you heard from her.
As a competent guitar player, I'm at the point where I don't like certain players because of the knowledge that being a musician imparts to me. For me one of these players is Slash. As a rock band, G'n'R is pretty great, but I can't just listen to them without analyzing Slash's playing. It sounds good, but it's not great in the guitar realm. When my relatives found out I was a guitar player they all seemed to jump on the "play me Sweet Child" bandwagon but when I explained that I didn't know it because I didn't like Slash, their response was akin to "shut up, he's famous and you're not, so he's done something right."
Meanwhile I was studying SRV, BB King, Townshend, and Hendrix who are arguably more important to rock than Slash. Can you see the disconnect here? It's not even a matter of talent unless the "victim" (for lack of a better word) is going around saying how much better they are than x or y; it's usually a matter of taste.
Let's be honest...lyrically and musically speaking it's all been done before and pretty much half the insane bullshit she does was done by Madonna before her.
oh hey look it's a normal hot person
Oh ok so because you like Bowies music more, so it's ok for him to act weird
the reason she became famous was because of her standing out. She HAD to stand out against the competition, otherwise no one would hear her, she was just another "aspiring" musician. Now, she's a somebody. She has a name. She can be normal if she wants to, but I think she enjoys being OTT, she knows it's working, she makes the headlines with every new outfit she comes up with. Plus, it must be fantastic to be a celebrity and have NO ONE recodnise you out of your "image" :)

I definitely understand where you're coming from and I appreciate the sentiment. I just feel sad when I look at myself and don't see what I would like. I've gotten over any embarrassment with regards to what others think. I'd really like to just be happy with what I have, and most of the time it's not on my mind at all, but if I'm being honest I'd love to fill in shirts and dresses better, not bust out of them, but just fit properly so they aren't hanging off of me. I hate clothes shopping and that's a big part of why, nothing is really designed for flat girls. Not in my income range anyway.
it's ok. small chested girls make me have a sad too.
It's probably because for her, it's about what she likes, not about what you do.
I don't think it's what she likes.  I think it's what she thinks that the world likes.
That's not a good thing. It's like saying, "Your breasts are so small, it's just like you had breast cancer and got them removed!"
Next time my girlfriend complains about her boobs I'll let her know that it's OK, at least she can wear suspenders.
Not that it's really the same thing but that's like telling a fat person "don't worry there's a ton of people who have fat fetishes!"
Obviously having small boobs is commonly more preferred than being fat but it's still not a super conforming sentiment.
Yeah, the way I see it.......okay, it's nice that you and others like small boobs, that people find them attractive. But I don't. And I'm the one who has to live with 'em.
Definitely still need a sports bra - though you're right that it's probably no where near as uncomfortable. They still bounce a little bit.
Not that I play golf but I've heard that it's also easier with small breasts.

So...what does Fucker actually mean then, in that language. I think it's important to know, I don't want to be sounding rude if I call someone a Fucker over there
